Given two problem descriptions for {problem_name}:

Description with worse performance (fitness: {worse_fitness}):
{worse_desc}

Description with better performance (fitness: {better_fitness}):
{better_desc}

Best implementation from worse description:
{worse_code}

Best implementation from better description:
{better_code}

Analyze why the better description led to better solutions:
1. What key elements in the better description guided the implementation toward better performance?
2. What aspects of the worse description may have misled or constrained the solution space?
3. What specific algorithmic insights or optimization strategies were better captured in the better description?

You respond with some hints for designing better description, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.
