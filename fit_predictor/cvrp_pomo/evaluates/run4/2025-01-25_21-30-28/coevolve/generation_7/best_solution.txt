Description:
The goal of this problem is to develop a sophisticated heuristic algorithm designed to address the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by achieving the optimal total distance traveled, while concurrently respecting strict vehicle capacity constraints. This algorithm will employ a combination of advanced optimization techniques, including dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, and tabu search, to iteratively enhance solution paths. The key aspects of the algorithm include the following:

1. Iterative refinement of node sequences to minimize travel distance, leveraging techniques such as the inverse distance heuristic to prioritize nearby nodes and the demand normalization heuristic to balance the allocation of customer demands.
2. Implementation of load balancing strategies to ensure that vehicle capacities are not exceeded, with a focus on dynamically adjusting the allocation of customer demands to individual vehicles.
3. Integration of advanced heuristics like the heuristic range adjustment, which adaptively modifies the search space based on the performance of previously evaluated solutions.
4. Utilization of normalization and inverse distance heuristics to enhance the overall performance of the algorithm.

The resulting solution must be robust and adaptable to real-world scenarios, producing balanced and optimal solutions that minimize travel time. Furthermore, the algorithm must maximize resource utilization by adhering to the capacity and demand constraints of the vehicles, thereby ensuring an efficient and effective resolution to the CVRP.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Inverse distance heuristic: edges with shorter distances are more promising
    inverse_distance = 1.0 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero

    # Demand normalization heuristic: edges with normalized demand closer to 1 are more promising
    demand_diff = torch.abs(normalized_demands - 1.0)
    demand_weight = 1.0 / (demand_diff + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero

    # Combine heuristics: sum the inverse distance and demand weight for each edge
    combined_heuristic = inverse_distance + demand_weight

    return combined_heuristic
