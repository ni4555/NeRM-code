Description:
The problem at hand is to develop an advanced heuristic for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with a focus on minimizing total route distance while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. This heuristic should integrate dynamic programming and genetic algorithm techniques to iteratively optimize node sequences and balance vehicle loads. The solution must account for real-world scenarios, such as varying edge weights and node demands, and should aim to minimize travel time and maximize resource utilization. Specific strategies include dynamically adjusting heuristic values based on edge weight and demand, and employing demand normalization to ensure load balancing across all vehicles.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    vehicle_capacity = demands.sum()
    demand_vector = demands / vehicle_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic for each edge based on the demand and distance
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * demand_vector
    
    # Adjust heuristics for load balancing by ensuring the sum of demands in each route does not exceed vehicle capacity
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                # Add a penalty for high demand edges to promote load balancing
                heuristics[i, j] = heuristics[i, j] - torch.max(torch.abs(demands[j] - demands[i]))
    
    # Normalize heuristics to ensure that they are in a good range for further processing
    heuristics = (heuristics - heuristics.min()) / (heuristics.max() - heuristics.min())
    
    return heuristics
