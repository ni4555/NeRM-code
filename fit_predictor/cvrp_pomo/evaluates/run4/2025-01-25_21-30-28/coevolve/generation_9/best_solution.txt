Description:
The objective of this problem is to design an advanced heuristic algorithm tailored to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), with the aim of minimizing the total travel distance while strictly adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. The algorithm should integrate a comprehensive set of optimization techniques, including dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, and tabu search, to iteratively refine and enhance solution paths. The following key aspects are integral to the algorithm's design:

1. Iterative path refinement using a combination of the inverse distance heuristic to prioritize proximity among nodes and the demand normalization heuristic to evenly distribute customer demands across vehicle routes.
2. Implementation of a sophisticated load balancing mechanism to guarantee that no vehicle exceeds its capacity, with a focus on dynamically reallocating customer demands among vehicles based on current load levels.
3. Utilization of heuristic range adjustment techniques to adaptively adjust the search space and exploit the performance of previously evaluated solutions for better optimization.
4. Incorporation of normalization and inverse distance heuristics to further improve the algorithm's overall performance.

The algorithm must be robust and adaptable to a variety of real-world scenarios, yielding balanced and optimal solutions that minimize travel time. Additionally, it must maximize resource utilization by ensuring that vehicle capacities and demand constraints are respected, resulting in an efficient and effective resolution to the CVRP.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the inverse distance heuristic
    inv_distance = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-6)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the demand normalization heuristic
    demand_heuristic = normalized_demands * distance_matrix
    
    # Combine the two heuristics
    combined_heuristic = inv_distance - demand_heuristic
    
    return combined_heuristic
