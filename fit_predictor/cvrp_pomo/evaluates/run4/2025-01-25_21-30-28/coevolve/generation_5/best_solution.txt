Description:
The goal is to design a heuristic algorithm that solves the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by minimizing the total distance traveled while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. The algorithm should leverage advanced techniques such as dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, or tabu search to iteratively refine solution paths. Key components include the optimization of node sequences to minimize distance, load balancing to ensure vehicle capacities are not exceeded, and the integration of heuristics like normalization and inverse distance to enhance performance. The algorithm must effectively handle real-world scenarios, resulting in a balanced and optimal solution that not only minimizes travel time but also maximizes resource utilization by adhering to the capacity and demand constraints of the vehicles.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the inverse of the distances
    inv_distance_matrix = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristics using the inverse distance and normalized demands
    heuristics = inv_distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    return heuristics
