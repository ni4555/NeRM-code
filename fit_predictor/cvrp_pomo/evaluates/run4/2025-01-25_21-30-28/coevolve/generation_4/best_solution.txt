Description:
Designing an algorithm to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by leveraging a combination of node sequence optimization and load balancing techniques. The algorithm should employ advanced heuristics to iteratively refine solution paths, ensuring that the total route distance is minimized while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. The key objective is to create a solution that not only finds the shortest path for each vehicle to visit all required nodes and return to the starting point but also effectively balances the load among vehicles to maximize resource utilization. This will involve integrating dynamic programming strategies, genetic algorithms, and tabu search to enhance the algorithm's performance and adaptability to complex real-world scenarios.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Assuming the distance matrix is symmetric
    # Calculate the difference in demands between each customer pair
    demand_diff = demands[:, None] - demands[None, :]
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference
    abs_demand_diff = torch.abs(demand_diff)
    
    # Calculate the maximum demand in the row (from depot to each customer)
    max_demand_row = torch.max(abs_demand_diff, dim=1)[0]
    
    # Calculate the maximum demand in the column (from each customer to depot)
    max_demand_col = torch.max(abs_demand_diff, dim=0)[0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum of the max demands in both directions
    min_max_demand = torch.min(max_demand_row, max_demand_col)
    
    # Calculate the heuristics based on the distance and demand difference
    heuristics = distance_matrix - min_max_demand
    
    # Normalize the heuristics to have a range of values
    min_heuristic = heuristics.min()
    max_heuristic = heuristics.max()
    heuristics = (heuristics - min_heuristic) / (max_heuristic - min_heuristic)
    
    return heuristics
