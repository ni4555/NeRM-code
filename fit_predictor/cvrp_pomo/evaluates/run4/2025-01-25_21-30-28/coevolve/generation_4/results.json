  "description": "Designing an algorithm to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by leveraging a combination of node sequence optimization and load balancing techniques. The algorithm should employ advanced heuristics to iteratively refine solution paths, ensuring that the total route distance is minimized while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. The key objective is to create a solution that not only finds the shortest path for each vehicle to visit all required nodes and return to the starting point but also effectively balances the load among vehicles to maximize resource utilization. This will involve integrating dynamic programming strategies, genetic algorithms, and tabu search to enhance the algorithm's performance and adaptability to complex real-world scenarios.",
