1. Integrate cumulative demand in heuristics, balance penalties, and normalize for clarity.
2. Employ non-linear transformations and scale penalties dynamically.
3. Use vectorization for efficiency, focusing on capacity and distance constraints.
4. Emphasize problem-specific properties and normalize by depot to improve heuristics.
