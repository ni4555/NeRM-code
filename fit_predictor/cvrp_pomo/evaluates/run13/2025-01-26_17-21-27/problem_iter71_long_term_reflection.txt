1. Modularize for clarity, focus core objectives, and detect overflow early.
2. Adapt penalties dynamically, balance exploration, and manage diversity carefully.
3. Integrate domain knowledge, use time-adaptive scaling, and simplify complexity.
4. Normalize objectives, control randomness, and balance exploitation with exploration.
5. Encourage diversity, refine penalties, and adapt to vehicle state dynamically.
