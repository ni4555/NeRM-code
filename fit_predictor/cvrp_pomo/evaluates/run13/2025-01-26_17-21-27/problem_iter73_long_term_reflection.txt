1. Modularize heuristics for clarity, focusing on core objectives and detecting overflow early.
2. Dynamically adjust penalties, balancing exploration and diversity.
3. Integrate domain knowledge, simplify complexity, and normalize objectives.
4. Encourage diversity with controlled randomness, prioritizing core heuristics.
5. Adapt penalties and scaling, using early overflow detection and domain-specific insights.
