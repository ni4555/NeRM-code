Design heuristics by:
- Prioritizing core objectives with adaptive scaling.
- Early overflow detection to prune suboptimal paths.
- Balancing exploration and exploitation through diversity and randomness.
- Modularizing for adaptability and clarity.
- Integrating demand-aware features for precision.
