1. Tailor penalties to current load, prioritize core objectives, and blend diverse heuristics.
2. Dynamically scale penalties and focus on avoiding overflow.
3. Introduce randomness, balance load, and cap heuristics to maintain diversity and stability.
4. Use vectorized operations, minimize complexity, and encourage diversity without noise.
