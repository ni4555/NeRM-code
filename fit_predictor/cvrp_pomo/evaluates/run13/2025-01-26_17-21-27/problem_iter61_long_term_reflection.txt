1. Emphasize core objectives; scale penalties adaptively.
2. Detect overflow early; balance exploration and exploitation.
3. Modularize heuristics; focus on critical constraints.
4. Integrate demand-aware features; optimize diversity control.
5. Use time-adaptive factors; cap randomness to avoid overfitting.
