1. Modularize for clarity, prioritize core objectives, and integrate early overflow detection.
2. Adapt penalties dynamically, balance exploration & exploitation, and manage diversity.
3. Use time-adaptive scaling, cap heuristics, and balance objectives with controlled randomness.
4. Simplify heuristics, optimize modularity, and integrate problem-specific features.
5. Normalize objectives, manage penalties, and balance exploration with diversity.
