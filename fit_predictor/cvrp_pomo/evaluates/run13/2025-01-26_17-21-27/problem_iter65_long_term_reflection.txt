1. Prioritize objectives; early detection reduces computation.
2. Modularize for clarity; balance exploration and exploitation.
3. Integrate demand; adapt penalties for capacity awareness.
4. Use diversity to prevent local optima; scale adaptively with context.
5. Focus core; prune suboptimal paths with overflow detection.
