1. Prioritize capacity, balance demand, and distance, using vectorized calculations and capacity-aware normalization.
2. Minimize redundancy, leverage cumulative sums, and optimize interactions for efficiency.
3. Normalize uniformly, penalize loops, and incorporate problem-specific features like demand scaling.
4. Utilize priority queues, dynamic penalties, and local search for iterative refinement.
