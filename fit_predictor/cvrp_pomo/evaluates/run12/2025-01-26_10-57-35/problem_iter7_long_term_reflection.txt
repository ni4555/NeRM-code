1. Prioritize demand-driven edges, balance capacity, and distance.
2. Vectorize computations, minimize loops, and normalize metrics consistently.
3. Integrate capacity constraints, optimize for cumulative stats, and leverage symmetry.
4. Use dynamic priority queues for edge selection, normalize demands, and update adaptively.
5. Focus on demand variance, distance correlation, and efficient data transformations.
