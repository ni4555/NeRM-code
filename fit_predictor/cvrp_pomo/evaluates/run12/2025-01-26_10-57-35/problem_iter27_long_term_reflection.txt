1. Optimize heuristics with vectorized operations, balanced cost functions, and efficient decay.
2. Integrate capacity constraints, normalize carefully, and minimize dominance.
3. Use non-negative normalization and simplify calculations for clarity and performance.
4. Prioritize edge quality, balance with capacity, and avoid overdominance.
5. Minimize dominance, enhance promising edges, and use vectorization for speed.
