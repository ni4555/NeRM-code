3. Integrate capacity constraints effectively.
4. Prioritize depot edges and balance heuristics.

Avoid redundant computations, focus on meaningful heuristics, and normalize consistently.
- Prioritize edge attributes that contribute directly to solution cost (e.g., demand).
- Minimize dominance by avoiding excessively high heuristic values.
- Use a combination of distance and demand to balance path attractiveness.
- Adjust for local effects like loop avoidance and capacity constraints.
1. Subtract demand from distance instead of adding it.
2. Normalize after each calculation to keep values bounded.
3. Ensure non-negativity and balance dominance.
4. Focus on balancing costs rather than amplifying.
1. Minimize complex operations.
2. Use subtraction for capacity constraint instead of addition.
3. Normalize and limit heuristics to prevent dominance.
4. Apply decay thoughtfully to balance values.
5. Optimize depot edge enhancement.
- Integrate both distance and demand with capacity.
- Balance heuristics, not subtract.
- Decay based on distance, encourage depot visits.
- Introduce penalties for overcapacity.
Use normalized weights, focus on depot, and ensure non-zero heuristic values.
Incorporate distance decay, normalize, penalize overcapacity, and tune factor balances.
Use normalization, consider balance, avoid excessive enhancement, and manage edge dominance.
Focus on edge weights, balance dominance, and adjust with decay factors.
Avoid unnecessary computations, use broadcasting, and simplify loops.
1. Incorporate a decay mechanism to mitigate edge dominance.
2. Adjust for capacity constraints more directly in heuristic calculation.
3. Consider fixed costs of key edges like the depot.
4. Avoid loops and overoptimization through constraint adjustments.
5. Balance high and low heuristic values with decay.
Minimize loops, balance demands, emphasize distance decay, and penalize overcapacity.
1. Use demand-driven distance normalization.
2. Prioritize edges based on both distance and demand.
3. Incentivize depot visits with higher heuristic values.
