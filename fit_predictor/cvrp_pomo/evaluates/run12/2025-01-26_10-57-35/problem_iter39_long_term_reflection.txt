1. Prioritize demand, distance, and capacity, using decay for balance.
2. Normalize early, apply penalties, and avoid loops; focus on depot edges.
3. Integrate capacity constraints, normalize consistently, and penalize overcapacity.
4. Enhance promising edges, normalize to prevent dominance, and use decay for distance.
5. Minimize complexity, use element-wise operations, and avoid redundant multiplications.
