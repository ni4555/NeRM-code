Description:
Develop a comprehensive heuristic-based solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that incorporates advanced normalization techniques for demand and distance to ensure uniformity across the problem instance. Implement a multi-faceted approach that begins with an Inverse Distance Heuristic (IDH) for initial customer distribution to vehicles, followed by a demand-sensitive penalty mechanism to prevent overloading of vehicles close to their capacity limits. Augment the initial solution through an iterative Genetic Algorithm (GA) process, which incorporates sophisticated crossover and mutation strategies for enhanced route optimization. Further optimize the routes by applying a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to explore potential solutions beyond local optima, and integrate Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to discover efficient traversal paths. The final solution must incorporate a dynamic rerouting system capable of swiftly adapting to real-time fluctuations in customer demand and vehicle availability, ensuring an agile and continuously optimized vehicle routing strategy.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure that the demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity
    vehicle_capacity = demands.max()
    normalized_demands = demands / vehicle_capacity

    # Initialize the heuristics matrix with zeros
    heuristics = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate the inverse distance heuristic
    heuristics = -distance_matrix

    # Incorporate demand-sensitive penalty mechanism
    # We add a penalty for edges that are close to the vehicle capacity limit
    demand_penalty = 0.1 * (1 - normalized_demands)
    heuristics += demand_penalty

    return heuristics
