  "description": "To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) solution, design a hybrid optimization framework integrating advanced heuristics and real-time responsiveness. This framework will leverage the strengths of Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and Ant Colony Optimization to iteratively refine vehicle assignments and route planning. Emphasize the implementation of dynamic load balancing algorithms to optimize capacity utilization and real-time rerouting algorithms to minimize route distances and accommodate unexpected changes. Integrate normalization techniques to normalize node demands and distances for a consistent comparison, and utilize a sophisticated penalty function to penalize non-optimal route selections. The goal is to achieve a balanced combination of optimized vehicle allocation, minimal route distances, and real-time operational flexibility while strictly adhering to vehicle capacity constraints.",
