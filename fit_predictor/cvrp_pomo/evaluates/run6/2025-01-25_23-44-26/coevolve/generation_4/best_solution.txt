Description:
The objective is to develop a robust heuristic solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that employs specific optimization techniques. The solution should incorporate a normalization process for demand and distance to ensure consistency in problem scale. An inverse distance heuristic will be used to initially assign customers to vehicles based on the reciprocal of their distance from the depot. To maintain capacity constraints, a demand penalty function will be implemented, which increases the cost of assigning customers with high demands to vehicles that are already close to capacity. The heuristic framework will integrate a Genetic Algorithm for iterative route improvement, a Simulated Annealing method to avoid local optima, and an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for learning and exploring efficient paths. The algorithm should be capable of handling dynamic changes in customer demands and vehicle availability by utilizing a real-time rerouting mechanism that responds to updates within a predefined time frame, ensuring that the vehicle assignments and route distances remain optimized.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize demands by total vehicle capacity (assuming demands are already normalized by capacity)
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Inverse distance heuristic: calculate the reciprocal of the distance
    inv_distance = 1.0 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    # Demand penalty function: increase cost for edges leading to vehicles close to capacity
    # We calculate the penalty based on the reciprocal of the demand to favor lower demand customers
    demand_penalty = 1.0 / (demands + 1e-8)
    capacity_penalty = (demands / total_capacity) * (1 - 1 / (demands + 1e-8))
    penalty = capacity_penalty * (inv_distance + 1e-8)
    
    # Combine heuristics: inverse distance and demand penalty
    combined_heuristics = inv_distance - penalty
    
    # Ensure negative values for undesirable edges and positive values for promising ones
    combined_heuristics = combined_heuristics.clamp(min=-1e8, max=1e8)
    
    return combined_heuristics
