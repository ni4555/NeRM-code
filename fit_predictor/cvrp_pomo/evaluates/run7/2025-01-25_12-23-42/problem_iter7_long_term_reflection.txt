1. Weigh demand with load, normalize inputs, & use non-linear scaling.
2. Blend exploration with heuristic balance, adapt dynamically based on load.
3. Introduce randomness sparingly, emphasizing problem-specific features.
4. Employ domain insights to create tailored, effective heuristics.
5. Normalize, optimize, & maintain a balance between exploitation & exploration.
