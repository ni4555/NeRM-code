```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Initialize the edge potential matrix
    edge_potential = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Compute the potential for each edge based on distance, with a direct penalty for high distances
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small positive constant to avoid division by zero
    edge_potential = 1 / (distance_matrix + epsilon)
    
    return edge_potential
```
