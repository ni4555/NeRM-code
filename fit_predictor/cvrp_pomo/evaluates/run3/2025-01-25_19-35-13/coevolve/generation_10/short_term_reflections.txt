Clarity, normalization, demand weighting, potential function, and balance.
Clarity, context, & detail crucial in descriptions; specifics, goals, & objectives clear.
1. Clarity on balancing computational efficiency & solution quality.
2. Emphasis on demand normalization & its impact on potential.
3. Reference to state-of-the-art techniques (metaheuristics, DP, neighborhood search).
4. Mention of handling capacity constraints explicitly.
5. Use of potential as a heuristic measure with specific considerations.
Key elements: balance, integration, resolution.
Constraining aspects: lack of specifics, DP vs. metaheuristics.
Insights: potential function, balance, and normalization. 
Better design hint: Specify objectives, algorithms, and desired properties.
