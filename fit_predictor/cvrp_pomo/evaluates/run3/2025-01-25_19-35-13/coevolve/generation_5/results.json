  "description": "Develop an algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that leverages advanced metaheuristic techniques to identify efficient routes that cover all nodes with a return to the origin, ensuring that no vehicle's total route demand exceeds its defined capacity. The objective is to minimize the total route distance while adhering to the capacity constraints. The algorithm must utilize a combination of dynamic programming to calculate optimal sub-routes, neighborhood search strategies for refining solutions, and local search algorithms to enhance solution quality. The optimization process should be carefully designed to balance the trade-off between computational efficiency and the solution's optimality.",
