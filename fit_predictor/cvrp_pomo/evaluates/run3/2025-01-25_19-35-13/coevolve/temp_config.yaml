description: To address the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) effectively,
  our algorithm will employ a sophisticated hybrid approach that synergizes between
  local and global optimization techniques. The strategy will involve a multi-phase
  heuristic that initializes with a demand normalization step to guarantee fairness
  across customer demands. This will be followed by an iterative process that combines
  a dynamic programming approach for sub-route optimization with an adaptive neighborhood
  search for continuous solution refinement. To ensure computational efficiency without
  compromising solution quality, we will integrate a novel potential function that
  effectively guides the search towards efficient routes while adhering to strict
  vehicle capacity constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm will incorporate state-of-the-art
  local search algorithms to enhance the final solution's robustness. Throughout the
  optimization process, we will prioritize minimizing total route distance while maintaining
  high-quality solutions, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
