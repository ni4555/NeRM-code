Description:
The problem at hand is to develop a robust and efficient heuristic algorithm for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), which involves optimizing the delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles to a set of geographically dispersed nodes while adhering to strict capacity constraints. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles while ensuring that each vehicle's route does not exceed its capacity limit, and that every node is visited exactly once. To achieve this, the algorithm must integrate a combination of advanced metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and neighborhood search strategies, which are designed to balance computational efficiency with the quality of the solution. The heuristic should incorporate normalization techniques to handle the varying scales of node distances and demands, utilize a potential function to guide the search for optimal routes, and employ an epsilon value to prevent division by zero errors. Additionally, the heuristic should leverage both distance and demand as key factors in evaluating the desirability of routes, thereby guiding the search towards solutions that are both near-optimal and computationally feasible.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure that the distance matrix and demands are of the same size
    assert distance_matrix.shape[0] == distance_matrix.shape[1] == demands.shape[0], "Mismatched dimensions"
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity (assuming total capacity is 1 for simplicity)
    normalized_demands = demands / demands.sum()
    
    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristic_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the potential function based on distance and demand
    # The potential function could be a weighted sum of the inverse of distance and the normalized demand
    # Here, we use a simple example where we weigh distance inversely with demand
    potential_function = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-10)  # Adding epsilon to avoid division by zero
    potential_function *= normalized_demands.unsqueeze(1)  # Unsqueeze for broadcasting
    
    # Compute the heuristic values by taking the negative of the potential function
    # Negative values are undesirable edges, positive values are promising ones
    heuristic_matrix = -potential_function
    
    return heuristic_matrix
