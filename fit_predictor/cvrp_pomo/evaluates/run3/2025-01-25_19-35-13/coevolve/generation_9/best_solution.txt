Description:
The development of an advanced heuristic algorithm specifically designed to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with the objective of minimizing the total route distance while adhering strictly to vehicle capacity constraints. The algorithm must efficiently integrate dynamic programming to identify optimal sub-routes, utilize neighborhood search strategies to refine solutions, and apply local search algorithms to enhance the quality of the route. The heuristic should be crafted to strike a balance between computational efficiency and solution optimality, ensuring that all nodes are covered with a return to the origin without exceeding the capacity of any vehicle. The algorithm must be precise in its problem specifics, employ a combination of metaheuristic techniques, and provide a clear and detailed optimization strategy.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristic_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values using the Chebyshev distance metric
    # This is a simple heuristic that considers the maximum of the distance and the demand
    heuristic_matrix = torch.clamp(distance_matrix + demands, min=0)
    
    return heuristic_matrix
