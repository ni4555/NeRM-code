1. Simplify and focus; leverage domain-specific features.
2. Minimize computation; employ vectorization and efficient data structures.
3. Shape the search space; adaptively penalize and reward.
4. Balance incentives and penalties; use dynamic weights.
5. Integrate DP bounds; optimize local search for diversity.
