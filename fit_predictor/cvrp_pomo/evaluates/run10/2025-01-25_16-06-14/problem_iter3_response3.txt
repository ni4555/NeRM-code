    # Calculate the total demand
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    # Scale the distance matrix by the total demand to give weight to total distance covered
    scaled_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / total_demand
    # Scale demands to the range [0, 1]
    scaled_demands = demands / demands.max()
    # Calculate the heuristic by considering both scaled distance and scaled demand
    # Use a linear combination with different weights to emphasize different aspects
    # Negative weights for distances to make them penalize longer distances
