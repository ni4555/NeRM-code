```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate cumulative demand for each node
    total_demand = demands.cumsum(0)
    # Calculate the difference between total demand and vehicle capacity
    demand_diff = (total_demand - demands[:, None]).clamp(min=0)
    # Normalize the demand difference to get a heuristic value
    # Since the heuristic should be directly proportional to the demand difference
    # we can simplify the normalization and remove the sigmoid function
    heuristic_values = -distance_matrix * demand_diff
    return heuristic_values
