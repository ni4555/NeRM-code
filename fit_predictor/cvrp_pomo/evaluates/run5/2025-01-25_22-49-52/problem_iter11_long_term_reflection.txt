1. Blend heuristics for adaptability, simplify for efficiency, and balance objectives.
2. Employ adaptive weights, normalize inputs, and leverage domain knowledge.
3. Integrate penalties, relax demands, and use sigmoid smoothing for transitions.
4. Focus on demand variance, avoid redundancy, and optimize for dynamic instances.
5. Test diverse heuristics, balance weights, and dampen penalties for realism.
