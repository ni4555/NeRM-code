Description:
Develop an innovative heuristic for the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) that emphasizes the minimization of route distances while strictly adhering to vehicle capacities. This heuristic should leverage a hybrid approach, combining constraint programming with dynamic window techniques and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to address intricate routing challenges effectively. By incorporating advanced methods like node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition, the heuristic will optimize route selection. It must be capable of real-time adaptation to dynamic problem instances, where customer demands and vehicle capacities are subject to change, and must exhibit robustness across diverse conditions. The heuristic should prioritize distance minimization, optimize vehicle load balancing, and maintain constraint satisfaction while ensuring rapid response and scalability.

    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    # Normalize demands with respect to vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristic_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Node partitioning: Partition the nodes into clusters based on demands
    # Here we use a simple threshold-based approach for demonstration
    threshold = 0.5
    high_demand_clusters = torch.where(normalized_demands > threshold)[0]
    low_demand_clusters = torch.where(normalized_demands <= threshold)[0]
    
    # Demand relaxation: Relax the demands slightly to improve load balancing
    relaxed_demands = demands * 0.95
    
    # Path decomposition: Calculate heuristic values for paths within and between clusters
    for i in range(n):
        if i in high_demand_clusters:
            # High demand nodes have higher heuristic values

        else:
            # Low demand nodes have lower heuristic values
            heuristic_matrix[i] = distance_matrix[i]
