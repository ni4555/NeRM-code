  "description": "Develop a novel optimization heuristic for a time-sensitive dynamic capacitated vehicle routing problem (DCVRP) that minimizes total route distances while enforcing vehicle capacities without exceeding them. The heuristic should incorporate a combination of constraint programming techniques, a dynamic window approach to handle real-time changes, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to ensure robustness and adaptability. The heuristic must employ node partitioning to optimize path decomposition and use demand relaxation to manage dynamic changes in node demands and vehicle capacities. The goal is to achieve a real-time solution that balances the trade-off between minimizing route distances and maintaining optimal vehicle load distribution, while maintaining clarity in the capacity and demand specifications and employing precise algorithmic components and performance criteria.",
