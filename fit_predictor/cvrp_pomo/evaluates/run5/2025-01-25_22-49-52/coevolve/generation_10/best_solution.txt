Description:
Develop a novel optimization heuristic for a time-sensitive dynamic capacitated vehicle routing problem (DCVRP) that minimizes total route distances while enforcing vehicle capacities without exceeding them. The heuristic should incorporate a combination of constraint programming techniques, a dynamic window approach to handle real-time changes, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to ensure robustness and adaptability. The heuristic must employ node partitioning to optimize path decomposition and use demand relaxation to manage dynamic changes in node demands and vehicle capacities. The goal is to achieve a real-time solution that balances the trade-off between minimizing route distances and maintaining optimal vehicle load distribution, while maintaining clarity in the capacity and demand specifications and employing precise algorithmic components and performance criteria.

    # Extract the size of the distance matrix
    n = distance_matrix.size(0)
    
    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristic_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Define the weight for demand relaxation
    demand_weight = 0.5
    
    # Demand relaxation for dynamic changes in node demands
    relaxed_demands = demands / (1 + demand_weight)
    
    # Node partitioning for path decomposition
    partition_threshold = 1.0  # This is an example threshold
    demand_threshold = 0.5     # This is an example threshold
    
    # Iterate over all edges
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, n):
            # Calculate the heuristic based on distance and relaxed demand
            edge_heuristic = distance_matrix[i, j] - relaxed_demands[i] - relaxed_demands[j]
            
            # Apply demand threshold to filter out edges with high demand
            if relaxed_demands[i] + relaxed_demands[j] > demand_threshold:
                edge_heuristic *= 0.1
            
            # Apply partition threshold to optimize path decomposition
            if i < partition_threshold or j < partition_threshold:
                edge_heuristic *= 0.9
