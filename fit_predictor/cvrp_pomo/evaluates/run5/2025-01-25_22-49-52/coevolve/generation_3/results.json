  "description": "Develop an advanced optimization heuristic for the dynamic capacitated vehicle routing problem (DCVRP), which is designed to minimize route distances while adhering strictly to vehicle capacities. This heuristic should integrate constraint programming, dynamic window approaches, and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to efficiently tackle complex routing challenges. Utilize node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition to optimize route selection. The heuristic must be capable of real-time adaptation and demonstrate robust performance in dynamic problem instances, where nodes' demands and vehicle capacities may change during execution. The solution should prioritize minimizing route distances and maintain optimal vehicle load balancing to ensure efficient routing.",
