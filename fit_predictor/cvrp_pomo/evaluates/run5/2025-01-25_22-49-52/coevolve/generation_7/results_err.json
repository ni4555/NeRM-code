  "description": "Design a sophisticated hybrid optimization framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that prioritizes route efficiency under stringent capacity constraints. This approach combines an enhanced Genetic Algorithm (GA) with advanced local search methods, including a state-of-the-art Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for fine-tuning. The framework initializes with a robust node partitioning strategy to ensure a strong starting solution, and incorporates demand relaxation to accommodate dynamic changes. By normalizing distance and demand metrics, the heuristic function computes a tailored potential value to steer the GA's exploration. The hybridization process begins with a node partitioning and demand relaxation phase, followed by extensive GA exploration and SA-based iterative refinement to achieve a delicate balance between solution diversity and optimization quality.",
