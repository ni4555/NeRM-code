  "description": "The problem description is as follows:\n\nDevelop an advanced heuristic for the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) that minimizes route distances while strictly adhering to vehicle capacities. This heuristic should integrate constraint programming with dynamic window approaches and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to efficiently solve complex routing challenges. The algorithm must incorporate node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition techniques to optimize route selection. It should be capable of real-time adaptation to dynamic changes in problem instances, such as varying node demands and vehicle capacities. The solution should prioritize the minimization of route distances, maintain optimal vehicle load balancing, and ensure robust performance even in the face of real-time updates and constraints.",
