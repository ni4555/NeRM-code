Description:
Problem Description:

Develop an optimized algorithm for solving the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) with a focus on minimizing route distances while enforcing strict adherence to vehicle capacities. The algorithm should incorporate constraint programming to enforce vehicle capacity constraints, a dynamic window approach to handle real-time changes in problem parameters, and a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to balance route distances and vehicle load distribution. Utilize node partitioning to efficiently decompose the problem, demand relaxation to mitigate the impact of dynamic changes, and path decomposition to enhance solution quality. The heuristic must be capable of real-time adaptation to dynamic problem instances, where nodes' demands and vehicle capacities may change during execution, and it should include a normalization technique to ensure consistent performance across varying problem scales. The solution should maximize efficiency and adaptability, demonstrating robust performance in complex, dynamic routing environments.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity by summing the demands
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands to represent fractions of the total capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Initialize a tensor with the same shape as the distance matrix to store heuristics
    heuristics = torch.full_like(distance_matrix, fill_value=-1e9)
    
    # Iterate over each node pair to calculate heuristics
    for i in range(distance_matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(distance_matrix.shape[1]):
            if i != j:  # Exclude the depot node from comparisons
                # Calculate the heuristic for the edge (i, j)
                heuristic = distance_matrix[i, j] - normalized_demands[i] * normalized_demands[j]
                heuristics[i, j] = heuristic
    
    return heuristics
