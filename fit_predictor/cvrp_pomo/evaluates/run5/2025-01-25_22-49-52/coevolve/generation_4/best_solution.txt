Description:
Develop a robust heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that minimizes route distances while strictly adhering to vehicle capacities. The algorithm should incorporate normalization of node distances and demands, calculate potential values for explicit depot handling, and utilize a simple yet effective integration of constraint programming and dynamic window approaches. The heuristic should aim to achieve balanced vehicle loads and adapt to dynamic changes in problem instances in real-time. The focus should be on clear objectives, efficient route selection, and avoiding the unnecessary complexity of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, ensuring that the algorithm is both specific and effective in addressing the CVRP.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of demands to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Normalize the distance matrix by dividing by the maximum distance in the matrix
    max_distance = distance_matrix.max()
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / max_distance
    
    # Calculate potential values for explicit depot handling
    # This could be based on some heuristic or simple formula
    depot_potential = normalized_distance_matrix[0] * 0.5  # Example: half the maximum distance to depot
    
    # Calculate potential values for each edge
    # Here we use a simple heuristic that combines normalized distance and normalized demand
    edge_potentials = normalized_distance_matrix + normalized_demands
    
    # Apply the depot potential to the edges leading from the depot
    edge_potentials[0] += depot_potential
    
    # Apply a simple constraint programming approach: minimize edges with high demands
    # This could be a simple threshold, or a more complex model depending on the needs
    high_demand_threshold = 1.5  # Example threshold
    edge_potentials[demands > high_demand_threshold] *= -1  # Mark as undesirable
    
    # Apply dynamic window approach: adjust potential values based on current vehicle loads
    # This could be a simple function or a more complex model depending on the needs
    # For simplicity, we assume vehicle loads are balanced and do not adjust the potential values
