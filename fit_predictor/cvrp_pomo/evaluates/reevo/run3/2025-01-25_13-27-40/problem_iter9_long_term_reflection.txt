- Blend non-linear scales with demand-aware penalties and symmetry for refined heuristics.
- Leverage decay and scaling, but prioritize core logic and capacity constraints.
- Normalize and clamp for consistency, using logarithmic and inverse scales as needed.
- Integrate penalties effectively, balancing exploration and exploitation while minimizing complexity.
