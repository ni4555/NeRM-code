1. Optimize multi-factor penalties; scale dynamically and adapt to problem state.
2. Emphasize core objectives; balance distance, load, and capacity.
3. Blend heuristics; use adaptive scaling for impact and efficiency.
4. Minimize computation; focus on key factors and vectorize operations.
5. Integrate dynamic scaling; balance penalties and encourage diversity.
