1. Integrate dynamic penalties tied to vehicle state and cumulative demand.
2. Prioritize core objectives with robust scaling to enhance solution quality.
3. Foster diversity in heuristic selection to escape local optima.
4. Balance load distribution with targeted penalties to prevent overflows.
5. Adaptively scale heuristics and penalties for early overflow and imbalance.
