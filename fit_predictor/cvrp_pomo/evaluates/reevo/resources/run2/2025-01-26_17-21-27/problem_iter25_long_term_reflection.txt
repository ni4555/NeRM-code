1. Minimize conditional logic; maximize vectorized efficiency.
2. Balance penalties, scale dynamically; ensure capacity overflow checks.
3. Leverage demand & distance scaling; balance load & penalties dynamically.
4. Integrate exponential decay; use nuanced scaling & demand awareness.
5. Normalize demands; scale bonuses & integrate overflow detection.
