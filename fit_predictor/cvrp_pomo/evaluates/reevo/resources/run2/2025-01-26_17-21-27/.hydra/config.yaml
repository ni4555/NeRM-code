  description: Assisting in solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with
    some prior heuristics. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all
    given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each
    vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot
    exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity,
    the vehicle must return to the starting node.
