1. Tailor penalties to load, blend objectives, and balance randomness.
2. Optimize penalties, scale by impact, and avoid redundancy.
3. Introduce dynamic scaling, prioritize core objectives, and adapt heuristics.
4. Simplify objectives, use vectorized ops, and balance diversity.
5. Focus on capacity constraints, balance penalties, and encourage diversity.
