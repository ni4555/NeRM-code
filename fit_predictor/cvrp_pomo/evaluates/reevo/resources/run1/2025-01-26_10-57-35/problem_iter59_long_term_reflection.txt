1. Balance demand & distance with dampening, normalize early, and use logarithmic scales for stability.
2. Minimize loops and dominance, adjust penalties for capacity, and focus on key factors.
3. Optimize by combining constraints, normalizing consistently, and balancing heuristics.
4. Simplify with direct demand-weighted distances, reduce complexity, and tune empirically.
