```python

    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    demands = demands.unsqueeze(1)  # Ensure demands is a 2D tensor for broadcasting
    distance_matrix_squared = distance_matrix ** 2
    min_distance = torch.min(distance_matrix, dim=1)[0] ** 2  # Squared distance to nearest customer
    max_demand = torch.max(demands, dim=0)[0]  # Maximum demand in the network
    
    # Calculate a heuristic that considers both distance and demand
    heuristic = -distance_matrix_squared + min_distance * max_demand
