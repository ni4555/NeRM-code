    # Normalize the distance matrix by the total demand
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / (total_demand + 1e-8)

    negative_matrix = -normalized_distance_matrix

    demand_weight = demands - 1e-8
    # Combine the distance and demand weight to create the heuristic
