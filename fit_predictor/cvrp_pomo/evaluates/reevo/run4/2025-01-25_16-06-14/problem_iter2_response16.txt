```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total demand for each node
    total_demand = demands.cumsum(0)
    # Calculate the difference between total demand and vehicle capacity
    demand_diff = (total_demand - demands[:, None]).clamp(min=0)
    # Normalize the demand difference to get a heuristic value
    # We add a small constant to avoid division by zero
    return -distance_matrix / (demand_diff + 1e-8)
```
