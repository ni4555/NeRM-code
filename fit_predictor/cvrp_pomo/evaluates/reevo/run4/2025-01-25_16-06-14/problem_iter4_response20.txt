    total_demand = demands.cumsum(0)
    # Calculate the difference between total demand and vehicle capacity
    demand_diff = (total_demand - demands[:, None]).clamp(min=0)
    # Normalize the demand difference by the sum of all demands to get a heuristic value

    # Combine the normalized demand difference with the distance matrix
