```python

    # Calculate the total demand for each node
    total_demand = demands.cumsum(0)
    # Calculate the difference between total demand and vehicle capacity
    demand_diff = (total_demand - demands[:, None]).clamp(min=0)
    # Normalize the demand difference by the maximum demand difference to get a heuristic value
    max_demand_diff = demand_diff.max()
    heuristic_values = -distance_matrix * demand_diff / (max_demand_diff + 1e-8)
