1. Blend greedy, nearest-neighbor, and domain-specific strategies.
2. Integrate capacity constraints early and optimize for path length.
3. Prioritize nodes by demand, distance, and capacity; balance local & global.
4. Leverage problem structure, minimize redundancy, and validate with real data.
5. Incorporate demand-to-capacity ratios, distance weighting, and dynamic adjustments.
