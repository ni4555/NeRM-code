1. Balance multi-criteria with penalties, not just heuristics.
2. Integrate heuristics for diversity; normalize demand & distance.
3. Use dynamic weights & domain-specific knowledge for refinement.
4. Combine local/global heuristics, prioritize demand/capacity.
5. Simplify computations, optimize balance & prevent infeasibilities.
