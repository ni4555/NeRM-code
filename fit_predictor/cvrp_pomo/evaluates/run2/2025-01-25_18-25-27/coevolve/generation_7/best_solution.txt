Description:
A novel optimization heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm that integrates adaptive genetic operators with enhanced local search techniques. This approach specifically targets the problem scope of finding efficient, capacity-constrained routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to geographically dispersed customers. The heuristic employs a clear problem-solving strategy that leverages the following:

1. A state-of-the-art evolutionary process with adaptive genetic operators, including a selection method based on fitness-probability ranking, an efficient crossover technique with a dynamic recombination rate, and a mutation scheme that selectively alters routes to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.

2. Advanced local search heuristics that incorporate a hybrid swap-insertion heuristic and a 2-opt variant optimized for capacity adherence while minimizing route length. These methods are complemented by a real-time penalty system that dynamically adjusts to the evolving population to enforce capacity constraints.

3. A normalization technique that scales customer demand to a common level, ensuring a fair comparison of solutions, and a constraint-aware optimization process that strategically allocates capacities to routes to minimize overloading and maximize efficiency.

4. Adaptive neighborhood and diversity management strategies that adjust the neighborhood structure based on evolutionary progress, employing a feedback mechanism to explore promising regions of the solution space and prevent stagnation in local optima.

This heuristic guarantees both distance efficiency and capacity adherence, delivering robust and computationally efficient route planning solutions while avoiding the pitfalls of traditional optimization methods.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize demands
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with high negative values
    heuristic_matrix = -torch.ones_like(distance_matrix)

    # Incorporate customer demands into heuristic matrix
    demand_penalty = 2 * (1 - normalized_demands)
    heuristic_matrix += demand_penalty * distance_matrix

    # Incorporate some additional heuristics if needed (e.g., distance-based)
    # For example, a simple distance-based heuristic could be:
    # heuristic_matrix += -distance_matrix
