  "description": "The proposed heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) employs a synergistic blend of evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic algorithms, with sophisticated local search heuristics. This hybrid strategy prioritizes both global route optimization and local capacity adherence, ensuring that the resultant solutions are not only distance-efficient but also strictly respect vehicle capacity limits. The evolutionary component fosters a diverse exploration of potential solutions, while the local search module refines these solutions to exploit neighborhood structures and enhance capacity management. This integrated approach is designed to yield high-quality, capacity-constrained routes within a computationally feasible timeframe, thereby circumventing the pitfalls of traditional optimization methods that may sacrifice efficiency for capacity or vice versa.",
