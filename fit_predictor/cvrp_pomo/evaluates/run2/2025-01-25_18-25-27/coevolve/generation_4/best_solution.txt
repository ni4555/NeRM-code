Description:
The novel heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) introduces a dynamic, hybrid optimization framework that synergistically employs evolutionary algorithms with advanced local search techniques to achieve robust route planning under stringent capacity constraints. This innovative approach is characterized by the following pivotal elements:

1. **Hybrid Evolutionary Strategy**: The core of the heuristic harnesses a state-of-the-art evolutionary process that incorporates adaptive genetic operators, including a novel selection method based on fitness-probability ranking, a highly efficient crossover technique with a dynamic recombination rate, and a sophisticated mutation scheme that selectively alters candidate routes to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.

2. **Enhanced Local Search Heuristics**: The local search component is bolstered by a set of innovative neighborhood exploration methods, including a hybrid swap-insertion heuristic and a 2-opt variant that prioritizes capacity adherence while concurrently optimizing route length. This module leverages a real-time penalty system that dynamically adjusts to the evolving population to ensure that vehicle capacities are not violated.

3. **Advanced Normalization and Constraint Handling**: The heuristic employs a novel normalization technique that scales the demand of customer nodes to a common demand level, enabling a fair comparison of solutions. It further integrates a constraint-aware optimization process that strategically allocates capacities to routes, minimizing the risk of overloading while maximizing route efficiency.

4. **Adaptive Neighborhood and Diversity Management**: The algorithm dynamically adjusts the neighborhood structure based on the evolutionary progress, using a feedback mechanism to identify and exploit promising regions of the solution space. This adaptive diversity management ensures a balanced exploration of the solution landscape, preventing stagnation in local optima.

This holistic strategy not only guarantees distance efficiency but also maintains strict adherence to vehicle capacity constraints, delivering high-quality solutions that are both robust and computationally efficient. The integration of these advanced techniques provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the complexities of the CVRP, leading to superior route planning outcomes.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    demands_sum = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / demands_sum
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix.clone() / distance_matrix.max()
    
    # Step 1: Apply a normalization technique to the distance matrix
    # Negative values for undesirable edges, positive for promising ones
    # Using the difference from the average distance as a heuristic
    average_distance = normalized_distance_matrix.mean()
    distance_heuristic = normalized_distance_matrix - average_distance
    
    # Step 2: Incorporate customer demand into the heuristic
    # More demand means more negative heuristic (undesirable edge)
    demand_heuristic = -normalized_demands
    
    # Combine the two heuristics
    combined_heuristic = distance_heuristic + demand_heuristic
    
    # Ensure the output has the same shape as the input distance matrix
    return combined_heuristic
