Description:
The objective is to develop a robust heuristic for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by incorporating advanced optimization techniques. The heuristic should efficiently address the challenge of finding the shortest routes that visit all customer nodes, respecting vehicle capacities, while minimizing total distance traveled. The solution should leverage a combination of genetic algorithms for global exploration and local search algorithms for local refinement, ensuring a balance between route efficiency and capacity constraints. The heuristic must be capable of producing high-quality solutions in a reasonable timeframe, adhering to the specific demands of the CVRP and avoiding common pitfalls such as overestimating efficiency at the expense of capacity constraints.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the difference in demands for each edge
    demand_diff = demands.unsqueeze(1) - demands.unsqueeze(0)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference to avoid negative values
    abs_demand_diff = torch.abs(demand_diff)
    
    # Calculate the heuristic based on the absolute difference
    # and add the distance matrix to encourage shorter paths
    heuristics = abs_demand_diff + distance_matrix
    
    return heuristics
