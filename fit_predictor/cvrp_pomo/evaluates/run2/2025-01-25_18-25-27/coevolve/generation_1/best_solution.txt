Description:
Enhance the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating advanced algorithms and optimization techniques. Focus on the development of heuristics that effectively balance route efficiency and vehicle capacity constraints. Implement a solution strategy that incorporates genetic algorithms for exploration and local search for refinement, ensuring that the computed paths optimize for both the total distance traveled and the utilization of vehicle capacities.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the negative demand as a heuristic value for the edge
    negative_demand = -normalized_demands

    # Compute the distance heuristic
    distance_heuristic = distance_matrix

    # Combine the negative demand and distance heuristic
    combined_heuristic = negative_demand + distance_heuristic

    return combined_heuristic
