Description:
The development of a hybrid optimization heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is required. This heuristic must integrate a suite of specialized techniques designed to address the complexities of the problem while ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation of the solution space. The following components are integral to the heuristic:

1. **Problem-specific Local Search (PLS)**: Employ PLS strategies tailored to the CVRP structure, ensuring efficient exploration of the neighborhood of solutions while respecting vehicle capacities and customer demands.

2. **Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO)**: Utilize APSO for exploration, where velocity and position update mechanisms are dynamically adjusted to adapt to the evolving solution space. Implement an adaptive population management strategy to maintain diversity and promote convergence towards optimal solutions.

3. **Dynamic Tabu Search with Adaptive Cost Function (DTSA)**: Integrate DTSA with a cost function that evaluates both load balance and distance traveled. This function should adaptively adjust to optimize the navigation through the solution space, avoiding previously explored suboptimal solutions while exploring new regions.

The heuristic will be modular in design, with each component contributing to the overall problem representation. This approach will prevent overgeneralization and ensure that the heuristic is both clear and effective in optimizing CVRP solutions. The primary objectives are to achieve optimal load distribution, minimize routing costs, and enhance the performance of the routing system.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    # Initialize the heuristics matrix with zeros
    heuristics_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the cost for each edge
    # Since the depot node is indexed by 0, the cost for the depot to itself is ignored
    # Cost is a sum of distance and normalized demand (since it's normalized, we just use it as is)
    cost_matrix = distance_matrix + demands
    
    # Apply a threshold to make edges negative for undesirable edges and positive for promising ones
    # This threshold can be adjusted based on the context
    threshold = torch.max(torch.abs(cost_matrix)) / 2
    heuristics_matrix = torch.where(cost_matrix > threshold, cost_matrix, -cost_matrix)
    
    return heuristics_matrix
