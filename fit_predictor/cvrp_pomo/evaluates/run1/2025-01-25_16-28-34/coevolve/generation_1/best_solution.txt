Description:
Optimizing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves developing an algorithm that strategically assigns vehicles to visit all customer nodes while adhering to their individual capacities. This entails identifying the most efficient routes, ensuring minimal travel distance, and optimizing load distribution to prevent exceeding vehicle capacities. The focus is on integrating advanced heuristic methods, such as tabu search, genetic algorithms, and local search, to iteratively refine route assignments and load balances. The algorithm should prioritize minimizing total travel distance, reducing vehicle usage, and enhancing overall system efficiency.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the negative of the demands as a heuristic penalty for high demands
    penalty = -demands
    
    # Use the distance matrix directly as the heuristic for travel cost
    travel_cost = distance_matrix.clone()
    
    # Combine the two into a single heuristic matrix
    heuristics = penalty + travel_cost
    
    return heuristics
