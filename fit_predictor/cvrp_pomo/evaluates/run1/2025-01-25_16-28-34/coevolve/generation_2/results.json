  "description": "Incorporate a hybrid evolutionary approach for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating local search and metaheuristic methods like particle swarm optimization (PSO) and tabu search. Emphasize the use of adaptive population management for PSO, which dynamically adjusts the velocity and position update mechanisms to converge on the optimal route assignments while maintaining diversity. Furthermore, employ a dynamic tabu list that considers the vehicle capacities and demand distribution, enabling the algorithm to navigate around previously visited suboptimal solutions. Prioritize an adaptive cost function that evaluates load balance and distance traveled, facilitating the identification of high-quality solutions and the exploration of unexplored regions of the solution space efficiently. This comprehensive algorithmic strategy should lead to enhanced system performance, optimal load distribution, and reduced overall routing cost.",
