  "description": "Enhance the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating advanced algorithms and optimization techniques. Focus on the development of heuristics that effectively balance route efficiency and vehicle capacity constraints. Implement a solution strategy that incorporates genetic algorithms for exploration and local search for refinement, ensuring that the computed paths optimize for both the total distance traveled and the utilization of vehicle capacities.",
