1. Balance key metrics, adapt heuristics, & integrate domain knowledge dynamically.
2. Simplify complexity, tune weights, & use relative measures to guide search.
3. Focus on critical factors, clamp extreme values, & adapt dynamically based on performance.
4. Normalize heuristics, balance global/local, & prioritize capacity constraints effectively.
