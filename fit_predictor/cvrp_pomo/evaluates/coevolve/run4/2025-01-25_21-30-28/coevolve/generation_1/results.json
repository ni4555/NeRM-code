  "description": "Optimizing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves implementing an efficient algorithm that minimizes total route distance while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. This entails employing advanced techniques such as dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, or tabu search to iteratively refine solution paths. Key algorithmic aspects include node sequence optimization, load balancing, and the integration of heuristics to handle complex real-world scenarios. By focusing on these elements, the goal is to achieve a balanced and optimal solution that minimizes travel time and maximizes resource utilization.",
