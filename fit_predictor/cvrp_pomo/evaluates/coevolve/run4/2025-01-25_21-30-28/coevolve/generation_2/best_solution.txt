Description:
The objective is to devise an innovative solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging cutting-edge optimization strategies such as evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimization, or local search techniques. The emphasis is on enhancing the efficiency of route planning by strategically optimizing node traversal order, load distribution across vehicles, and incorporating robust heuristics to address intricate real-world scenarios. The proposed algorithm must prioritize minimizing the overall travel distance while adhering to strict vehicle capacity limitations. A successful strategy will be characterized by its ability to achieve an optimal node sequence, balanced load distribution, and ensure every node is served within the vehicle's capacity constraints, thereby significantly reducing travel time and optimizing resource allocation.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the normalized distance matrix
    normalized_distance = distance_matrix / distance_matrix.max()
    
    # Calculate the potential benefits of each edge based on demand
    demand_heuristic = 1 - (demands / demands.sum())
    
    # Combine the normalized distance with the demand heuristic
    heuristics = normalized_distance * demand_heuristic
    
    return heuristics
