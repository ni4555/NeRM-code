description: 'The proposed solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
  integrates a dynamic and adaptive heuristic framework to achieve optimal route configurations
  under strict capacity constraints. This approach encompasses a multi-faceted strategy
  that leverages advanced optimization techniques, including:


  1. A hybrid iterative optimization process that synergistically employs both the
  Normalization and Inverse Distance heuristics to systematically refine node sequences,
  ensuring efficient allocation of customer demands and minimizing total travel distance.

  2. A robust load balancing mechanism designed to dynamically distribute demands
  among vehicles, thereby guaranteeing adherence to vehicle capacity limits and preventing
  overcapacity scenarios.

  3. The implementation of a state-of-the-art heuristic range adjustment mechanism
  that actively expands or contracts the search space based on the performance of
  previously evaluated solutions, thereby promoting deeper exploration of the solution
  space and enhancing solution quality.

  4. An iterative improvement phase that utilizes a combination of normalization and
  inverse distance heuristics to iteratively optimize the balance and efficiency of
  the route configurations.


  The resultant algorithm is engineered to be highly robust and adaptable, capable
  of efficiently resolving complex CVRP instances with a focus on achieving balanced
  and optimal routes that minimize travel time. It strictly adheres to vehicle capacity
  and demand constraints, maximizing resource utilization and delivering a solution
  that is both efficient and effective.'
