  "description": "The problem at hand is to develop an advanced heuristic for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with a focus on minimizing total route distance while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. This heuristic should integrate dynamic programming and genetic algorithm techniques to iteratively optimize node sequences and balance vehicle loads. The solution must account for real-world scenarios, such as varying edge weights and node demands, and should aim to minimize travel time and maximize resource utilization. Specific strategies include dynamically adjusting heuristic values based on edge weight and demand, and employing demand normalization to ensure load balancing across all vehicles.",
