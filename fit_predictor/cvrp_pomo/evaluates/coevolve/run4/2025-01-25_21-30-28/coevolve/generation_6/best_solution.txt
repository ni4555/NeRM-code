Description:
The primary goal is to devise a sophisticated heuristic algorithm tailored for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), emphasizing the minimization of total travel distance while rigorously enforcing vehicle capacity constraints. This algorithm will integrate a combination of dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, and tabu search to iteratively refine solution paths. Special attention will be given to optimizing the order of customer deliveries, ensuring load balancing across vehicles to prevent overcapacity, and incorporating advanced heuristics like normalization and inverse distance to enhance efficiency. The algorithm is designed to handle intricate real-world scenarios, resulting in a balanced and optimal solution that not only minimizes travel time but also maximizes resource utilization. This is achieved by meticulously adhering to both vehicle capacity and demand constraints, offering an efficient and effective solution to the CVRP that ensures high resource efficiency and compliance with operational limitations.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the inverse distance for each edge
    inverse_distance = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero

    # Combine the inverse distance with the normalized demands
    heuristics = inverse_distance * normalized_demands

    # Return the heuristics matrix
    return heuristics
