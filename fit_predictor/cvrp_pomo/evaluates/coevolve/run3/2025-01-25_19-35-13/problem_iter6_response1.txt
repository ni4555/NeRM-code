```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total demand to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands to have the sum of all demands equal to the vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # The heuristic will be based on the normalized demand (which represents the relative capacity required)
    # and the inverse of the distance, with a soft thresholding approach to keep values within a range
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small positive constant to avoid division by zero
    edge_potential = torch.clamp(normalized_demands / (distance_matrix + epsilon), min=-0.1, max=0.1)
