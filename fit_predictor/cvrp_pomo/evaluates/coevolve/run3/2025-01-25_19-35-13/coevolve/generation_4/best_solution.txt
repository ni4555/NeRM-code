Description:
Enhancing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating state-of-the-art optimization heuristics. The goal is to identify an optimal route that covers all designated nodes, including a return to the origin, while adhering to the capacity constraints of each vehicle. This problem requires careful consideration of each node's unique demand, and the cumulative demand along any route must not exceed the vehicle's capacity. When the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity, the vehicle must backtrack to the starting point. The solution will utilize a combination of metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and neighborhood search strategies to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. Specifically, the approach will incorporate techniques such as genetic algorithms for global exploration, simulated annealing for avoiding local optima, and the nearest neighbor heuristic for efficient initial solution generation, while ensuring that the neighborhood search considers potential edges with high heuristic values to guide the search towards optimal routes.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    demand_vector = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic for each edge based on the demands and distances
    heuristics = (1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-5)) * (1 - demand_vector)
    
    return heuristics
