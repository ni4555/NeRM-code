Description:
Enhancing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by implementing a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines advanced optimization techniques. The goal is to find an optimal route for a fleet of vehicles starting and ending at a central depot, visiting all customer nodes without exceeding the vehicle capacity constraints. Each node has a specific demand, and the route must satisfy the condition that the sum of demands visited by each vehicle does not exceed its capacity limit. The hybrid algorithm should integrate a metaheuristic, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), with local search strategies like 2-opt and swap to ensure both computational efficiency and solution quality. The metaheuristic will be employed to explore the solution space broadly and quickly converge to a near-optimal solution, while the local search strategies will refine the solution by making incremental improvements. Problem-specific constants to consider include vehicle capacities, the number of vehicles, and the distances between nodes. To maintain scalability, normalization techniques will be applied to the node demands and distances to ensure a fair comparison across different instances of the problem.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure the demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the heuristics
    # For this example, we use a simple heuristic where we subtract the demand from the distance
    # to get a negative value for promising edges. The smaller the distance, the more promising the edge.
    heuristics = distance_matrix - (normalized_demands * distance_matrix)

    # Clip the values to ensure no negative heuristics
    heuristics = torch.clamp(heuristics, min=0)

    return heuristics
