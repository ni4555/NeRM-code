  "description": "Enhancing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through the implementation of advanced heuristic algorithms. This problem necessitates the discovery of an optimal route that encompasses all designated nodes while ensuring a return to the origin. Each node presents a unique demand, and each vehicle is equipped with a specified capacity limit. The cumulative demand for nodes along any vehicle's route must not surpass its capacity threshold. In cases where the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity, the vehicle must backtrack to the starting point. To optimize this process, we will explore and integrate state-of-the-art techniques such as metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and neighborhood search strategies, aiming to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality.",
