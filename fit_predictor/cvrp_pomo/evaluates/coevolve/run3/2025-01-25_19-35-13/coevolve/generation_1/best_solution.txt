Description:
Enhancing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through the implementation of advanced heuristic algorithms. This problem necessitates the discovery of an optimal route that encompasses all designated nodes while ensuring a return to the origin. Each node presents a unique demand, and each vehicle is equipped with a specified capacity limit. The cumulative demand for nodes along any vehicle's route must not surpass its capacity threshold. In cases where the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity, the vehicle must backtrack to the starting point. To optimize this process, we will explore and integrate state-of-the-art techniques such as metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and neighborhood search strategies, aiming to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total demand to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands to have the sum of all demands equal to the vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Compute the potential for each edge based on distance and demand
    # The potential is a function of the distance (the higher the distance, the lower the potential)
    # and the normalized demand (the higher the demand, the higher the potential).
    # Here, we use a simple heuristic: the potential is inversely proportional to the distance
    # and proportional to the demand, with a small positive constant to avoid division by zero.
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small positive constant to avoid division by zero
    edge_potential = normalized_demands * (1 / (distance_matrix + epsilon))
