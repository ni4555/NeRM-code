This problem necessitates the discovery of an optimal route that encompasses all designated nodes while ensuring a return to the origin. Each node presents a unique demand, and each vehicle is equipped with a specified capacity limit. The cumulative demand for nodes along any vehicle's route must not surpass its capacity threshold. In cases where the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity, the vehicle must backtrack to the starting point.

The goal is to find an optimal route for a fleet of vehicles starting and ending at a central depot, visiting all customer nodes without exceeding the vehicle capacity constraints. Each node has a specific demand, and the route must satisfy the condition that the sum of demands visited by each vehicle does not exceed its capacity limit. The hybrid algorithm should integrate a metaheuristic, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), with local search strategies like 2-opt and swap to ensure both computational efficiency and solution quality. The metaheuristic will be employed to explore the solution space broadly and quickly converge to a near-optimal solution, while the local search strategies will refine the solution by making incremental improvements. Problem-specific constants to consider include vehicle capacities, the number of vehicles, and the distances between nodes. To maintain scalability, normalization techniques will be applied to the node demands and distances to ensure a fair comparison across different instances of the problem.",

To achieve this, the algorithm must integrate a combination of advanced metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and neighborhood search strategies, which are designed to balance computational efficiency with the quality of the solution. The heuristic should incorporate normalization techniques to handle the varying scales of node distances and demands, utilize a potential function to guide the search for optimal routes, and employ an epsilon value to prevent division by zero errors.
