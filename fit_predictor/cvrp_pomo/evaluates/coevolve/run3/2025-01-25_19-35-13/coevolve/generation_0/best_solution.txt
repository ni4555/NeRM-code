Description:
Assisting in solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with some prior heuristics. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # The heuristic approach is quite flexible, but one common heuristic is to use the inverse of the demand
    # multiplied by the distance. This gives a weight to the edges that depends both on the distance and
    # the demand, where higher demand or lower distance are more favorable. The negative sign will
    # push undesirable edges to negative values.

    # Calculate the negative of the demand vector, which will make larger demands have more positive
    # weights and smaller demands have more negative weights.
    negative_demands = -demands

    # Element-wise multiplication of the negative demand vector with the distance matrix.
    # This will emphasize shorter paths with higher demand, which might be more important
    # depending on the problem's context.
    demand_weighted_distances = negative_demands.unsqueeze(1) * distance_matrix

    # We can introduce a positive constant to prevent division by zero and to adjust the scale.
    # The choice of the constant will depend on the problem's specific scale.
    constant = 0.1  # This is a hyperparameter that may need to be tuned.

    # Divide the demand-weighted distances by a constant, which helps in scaling the heuristic values.
    scaled_demands = demand_weighted_distances / constant

    # Normalize the entire matrix so that promising edges get positive values and undesirable edges get
    # negative values.
    max_demand_weighted_distance = torch.max(scaled_demands)
    min_demand_weighted_distance = torch.min(scaled_demands)

    # The heuristic matrix, ensuring it has the required sign for desirable and undesirable edges.
    heuristics_matrix = scaled_demands - max_demand_weighted_distance + min_demand_weighted_distance
