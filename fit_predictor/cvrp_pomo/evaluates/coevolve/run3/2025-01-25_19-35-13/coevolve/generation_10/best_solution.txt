Description:
To address the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) effectively, our algorithm will employ a sophisticated hybrid approach that synergizes between local and global optimization techniques. The strategy will involve a multi-phase heuristic that initializes with a demand normalization step to guarantee fairness across customer demands. This will be followed by an iterative process that combines a dynamic programming approach for sub-route optimization with an adaptive neighborhood search for continuous solution refinement. To ensure computational efficiency without compromising solution quality, we will integrate a novel potential function that effectively guides the search towards efficient routes while adhering to strict vehicle capacity constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm will incorporate state-of-the-art local search algorithms to enhance the final solution's robustness. Throughout the optimization process, we will prioritize minimizing total route distance while maintaining high-quality solutions, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize customer demands
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Compute the negative of distances for heuristics
    # (we want to promote short distances as positive values)
    negative_distances = -distance_matrix
    
    # Combine normalized demands with the negative distances
    # We add demands to encourage selection of nodes with high demand
    heuristics = negative_distances + normalized_demands
    
    # Avoid promoting edges that lead to overflow by adding the total capacity
    # This ensures that edges with higher than total capacity are not selected
    heuristics += demands[:, None] - total_capacity
    
    return heuristics
