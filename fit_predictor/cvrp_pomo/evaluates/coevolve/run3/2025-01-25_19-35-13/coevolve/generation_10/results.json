  "description": "To address the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) effectively, our algorithm will employ a sophisticated hybrid approach that synergizes between local and global optimization techniques. The strategy will involve a multi-phase heuristic that initializes with a demand normalization step to guarantee fairness across customer demands. This will be followed by an iterative process that combines a dynamic programming approach for sub-route optimization with an adaptive neighborhood search for continuous solution refinement. To ensure computational efficiency without compromising solution quality, we will integrate a novel potential function that effectively guides the search towards efficient routes while adhering to strict vehicle capacity constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm will incorporate state-of-the-art local search algorithms to enhance the final solution's robustness. Throughout the optimization process, we will prioritize minimizing total route distance while maintaining high-quality solutions, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.",
