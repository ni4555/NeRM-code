```python

    # Calculate the total demand to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands to have the sum of all demands equal to the vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Compute the potential for each edge based on distance and demand
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small positive constant to avoid division by zero
    edge_potential = normalized_demands * (1 / (distance_matrix + epsilon))
