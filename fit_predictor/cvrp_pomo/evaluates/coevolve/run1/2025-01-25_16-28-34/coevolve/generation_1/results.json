  "description": "Optimizing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves developing an algorithm that strategically assigns vehicles to visit all customer nodes while adhering to their individual capacities. This entails identifying the most efficient routes, ensuring minimal travel distance, and optimizing load distribution to prevent exceeding vehicle capacities. The focus is on integrating advanced heuristic methods, such as tabu search, genetic algorithms, and local search, to iteratively refine route assignments and load balances. The algorithm should prioritize minimizing total travel distance, reducing vehicle usage, and enhancing overall system efficiency.",
