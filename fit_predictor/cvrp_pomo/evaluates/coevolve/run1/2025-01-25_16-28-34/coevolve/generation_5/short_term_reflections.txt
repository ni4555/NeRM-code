1. Specificity on demand and capacity constraints.
2. Generality and lack of detail in performance criteria.
3. Iterative heuristic refinement and demand-based evaluation.
4. Hints: Specify constraints, demand handling, and heuristic criteria.
1. Key elements: Problem-specific normalization, node demand awareness, distance-based heuristic.
2. Misled/constrained: Overly complex hybrid approach, lack of demand-awareness in heuristics.
3. Insights: Heuristic based on demand and distance, direct computation loop for heuristic values.

Hint: Focus on problem specifics, simplify complexity, and define clear heuristic objectives.
1. Problem-specific metrics, 2. Avoid vague descriptions, 3. Specify algorithmic nuances
1. Specific heuristic formulation.
2. Overgeneralized methods without clear implementation details.
3. Problem space constraints and direct calculation of heuristic values.
1. Specific heuristic formulation, demand-based edge evaluation.
2. Vague "adaptive" terms, lack of detailed heuristic explanation.
3. Problem-specific normalization, edge-based demand evaluation.
