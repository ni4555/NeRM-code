Description:
The goal is to design an efficient optimization heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that combines domain-specific insights with simplicity in implementation. The heuristic should prioritize a direct approach using normalized demand and distance as key elements, ensuring clarity and specificity. The heuristic should integrate a basic yet effective local search strategy to refine initial solutions while maintaining an optimal balance between load distribution and distance traveled. This approach will avoid overly complex adaptive mechanisms and will focus on problem context to yield improved system performance, optimal load distribution, and reduced overall routing costs. The new problem description is as follows:

---

Develop a streamlined heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that leverages normalized demand and distance metrics to find an efficient route. The heuristic should initiate by assigning routes based on demand and distance, using a greedy approach to distribute the load evenly across vehicles. Subsequently, employ a simple local search technique to refine the initial solutions, exploring neighboring routes that improve load balance and reduce the total distance traveled. The heuristic should prioritize solutions with a high degree of load uniformity and minimal route deviation, while avoiding unnecessary complexity to ensure quick convergence and practical implementation.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity (sum of demands)
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the normalized distance matrix
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / distance_matrix.max()
    
    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristic_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Apply the greedy approach to assign routes based on demand and distance
    for i in range(1, len(normalized_demands)):
        for j in range(1, len(normalized_demands)):
            if j != i:
                # Calculate the heuristic value for the edge (i, j)
                heuristic_value = -normalized_distance_matrix[i, j] + normalized_demands[i]
                # Update the heuristic matrix
                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = heuristic_value
    
    return heuristic_matrix
