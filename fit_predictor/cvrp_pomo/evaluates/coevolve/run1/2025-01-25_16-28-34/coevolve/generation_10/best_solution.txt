Description:
Develop a state-of-the-art hybrid optimization framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by incorporating a tailored local search module, an adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with evolving population control, and a dynamic tabu search approach. This framework should emphasize the following pivotal elements to harmonize exploration and exploitation, while ensuring comprehensive search space exploration:

1. **Customized Local Search**: Craft a sophisticated neighborhood exploration process that strictly adheres to vehicle capacity constraints and demand patterns, guaranteeing the generation of feasible and well-balanced neighborhoods.

2. **Advanced PSO with Adaptive Population Dynamics**: Integrate an adaptive PSO algorithm with a dynamic adjustment mechanism for velocity and position update rules. The population management should dynamically adapt to preserve diversity and accelerate convergence towards the optimal solution.

3. **Intelligent Tabu Search with a Flexible Cost Model**: Implement a tabu search mechanism that is capable of adapting to vehicle capacities and demand distributions, enabling the algorithm to navigate intricate solution landscapes and avoid suboptimal traps. The cost function should be highly adaptive, considering both load distribution and routing costs to guide the search process effectively.

The proposed algorithm should be modular in design, facilitating the isolation and analysis of individual heuristic components. It should prioritize a focused, problem-specific optimization strategy that optimizes load distribution, minimizes routing costs, and enhances overall system performance, while circumventing the drawbacks of static neighborhood structures, ineffective population management, and inflexible tabu list adaptability.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands by total capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Initialize the heuristics matrix with zeros
    heuristics = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Iterate over the distance matrix to calculate heuristics
    for i in range(distance_matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(distance_matrix.shape[1]):
            if i != j:
                # Calculate the heuristic value for each edge
                # Here we use a simple heuristic that considers the demand at customer j
                # and the distance from customer i to j. This is a naive approach and
                # can be replaced with more sophisticated heuristics.
                heuristics[i, j] = -normalized_demands[j] + distance_matrix[i, j]
    
    return heuristics
