Key elements for better performance: specific algorithms, adaptive components, modular integration. 

Misled or constrained aspects: generic statements, lack of specifics on adaptation, no mention of modular approach.

Algorithmic insights captured: local search tailoring, adaptive PSO, dynamic tabu list with adaptive cost. 

Design hint: Detail adaptive and modular heuristics with problem specifics.
1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Emphasize specific heuristics and algorithms.
2. **Component Integration**: Define how to combine local search, PSO, and tabu search.
3. **Problem-Specific Adjustments**: Mention how to tailor heuristics to CVRP specifics.
1. Key Elements: Specific local search, adaptive PSO, dynamic tabu search, adaptive cost.
2. Misled Constraints: Lack of specific local search, PSO population management, tabu list dynamics.
3. Insights: Modularity, problem-specific heuristics, adaptive strategies.

**Design Hints:**
