description: Develop a comprehensive heuristic solution for the Capacitated Vehicle
  Routing Problem (CVRP) that integrates demand normalization to ensure uniform problem
  scale. Implement a unified penalty function for capacity constraints, ensuring that
  vehicles operating near full capacity face a higher routing cost. Strategically
  combine demand-driven heuristics with a dynamic, real-time rerouting mechanism,
  incorporating elements of the Inverse Distance Heuristic (IDH) for initial customer
  assignment, and a hybrid optimization approach that leverages the strength of Genetic
  Algorithms for iterative improvement, Simulated Annealing to avoid local optima,
  and Ant Colony Optimization for path exploration. This algorithmic framework must
  be adaptable to real-time changes in customer demands and vehicle capacities, thereby
  maintaining optimal route distances and vehicle assignments while minimizing the
  total travel cost and enhancing overall efficiency.
