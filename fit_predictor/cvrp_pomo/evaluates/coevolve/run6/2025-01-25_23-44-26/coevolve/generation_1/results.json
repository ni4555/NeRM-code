Focus on the development of an algorithmic framework that optimally assigns vehicles to delivery routes while adhering to capacity constraints. Emphasize the integration of dynamic routing techniques, load balancing algorithms, and real-time rerouting capabilities to minimize total route distance and enhance efficiency.",
