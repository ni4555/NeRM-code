Description:
Design an optimization heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that integrates a normalized demand and distance adjustment mechanism with a specific inverse distance heuristic for initial customer assignment. The heuristic should incorporate a demand penalty function that scales the cost of assigning high-demand customers to vehicles near their capacity limit. To ensure efficient route assignments, the heuristic must utilize a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for iterative route improvement, a Simulated Annealing (SA) method to navigate past local optima, and an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for path exploration. The algorithm must be equipped with a real-time rerouting capability to adapt to dynamic changes in customer demands and vehicle availability within a predefined response time frame. The heuristic must explicitly define penalty functions, avoid general objectives, specify all employed heuristics and algorithms, and adhere to constraints such as vehicle capacity, demand, and real-time rerouting requirements to minimize total route distance and enhance operational efficiency.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    vehicle_capacity = demands.sum()  # Assuming vehicle capacity is equal to total demand

    # Demand penalty function: higher demand customers closer to capacity get higher penalties
    demand_penalty = 1 + demands / vehicle_capacity

    # Normalize distance matrix by demand penalty to adjust for customer demand
    adjusted_distance = distance_matrix / demand_penalty

    # Inverse distance heuristic: edges with lower adjusted distance are more promising
    # We use negative values to indicate undesirable edges (for minimization)
    heuristics = -adjusted_distance

    return heuristics
