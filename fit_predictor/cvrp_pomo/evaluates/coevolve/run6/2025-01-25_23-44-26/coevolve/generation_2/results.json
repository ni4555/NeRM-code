  "description": "The development of an advanced heuristic framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that incorporates dynamic routing techniques, load balancing algorithms, and real-time rerouting capabilities. The framework shall employ normalization techniques to scale node demands and distances, integrate a penalty function to discourage inefficient route decisions, and combine heuristic strategies such as Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimization. The goal is to optimize vehicle assignments to delivery routes while adhering to capacity constraints, minimize total route distance, and enhance overall efficiency in real-time scenarios.",
