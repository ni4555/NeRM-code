Description:
The development of an advanced heuristic framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that incorporates dynamic routing techniques, load balancing algorithms, and real-time rerouting capabilities. The framework shall employ normalization techniques to scale node demands and distances, integrate a penalty function to discourage inefficient route decisions, and combine heuristic strategies such as Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimization. The goal is to optimize vehicle assignments to delivery routes while adhering to capacity constraints, minimize total route distance, and enhance overall efficiency in real-time scenarios.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure the demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity
    vehicle_capacity = demands.sum()
    demands = demands / vehicle_capacity

    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with zeros
    heuristics_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate the potential heuristics value for each edge
    # This can be a simple heuristic such as the inverse of the demand (promising edges)
    # and negative values for large distances (undesirable edges).
    # Here we use a weighted sum of the inverse demand and negative distance.
    heuristics_matrix = demands * -distance_matrix

    # Normalize the heuristic matrix to ensure it has a similar scale to the distances
    heuristics_matrix = heuristics_matrix / heuristics_matrix.norm(p=1)

    return heuristics_matrix
