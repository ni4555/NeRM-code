  "description": "Develop a comprehensive heuristic solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that integrates demand normalization to ensure uniform problem scale. Implement a unified penalty function for capacity constraints, ensuring that vehicles operating near full capacity face a higher routing cost. Strategically combine demand-driven heuristics with a dynamic, real-time rerouting mechanism, incorporating elements of the Inverse Distance Heuristic (IDH) for initial customer assignment, and a hybrid optimization approach that leverages the strength of Genetic Algorithms for iterative improvement, Simulated Annealing to avoid local optima, and Ant Colony Optimization for path exploration. This algorithmic framework must be adaptable to real-time changes in customer demands and vehicle capacities, thereby maintaining optimal route distances and vehicle assignments while minimizing the total travel cost and enhancing overall efficiency.",
