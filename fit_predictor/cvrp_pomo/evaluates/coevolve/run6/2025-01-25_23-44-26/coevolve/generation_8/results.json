  "description": "Develop a comprehensive heuristic solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that integrates a variety of advanced optimization techniques. The algorithm should begin with a normalization process to ensure consistency in the scale of customer demand and distances. Utilize a balanced initial assignment of customers to vehicles, incorporating both an inverse distance heuristic and a load balancing algorithm to distribute demand evenly. To enforce capacity constraints, implement a dynamic demand penalty function that adapts to the current load of each vehicle. Enhance the solution with a multi-modal heuristic framework that includes a Genetic Algorithm for iterative route improvement, a Simulated Annealing method to escape local optima, and an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for efficient path exploration. The system must be capable of real-time rerouting in response to dynamic changes in customer demands and vehicle availability, ensuring that route distances remain optimized and within capacity limits. The overall approach should balance the need for rapid adaptation with the pursuit of optimal solutions, thereby minimizing total route distance and enhancing operational efficiency.",
