Description:
Design a real-time adaptive heuristic for the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) that minimizes route distances while adhering strictly to vehicle capacities. Implement a dynamic window approach with constraint programming to efficiently manage complex routing challenges. Utilize node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition to optimize route selection. The heuristic should employ an explicit potential value heuristic for direct potential value calculation, ensuring robust performance in dynamic problem instances. The focus is on maintaining clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and achieving successful optimization strategies for effective route planning.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity
    vehicle_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands by vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / vehicle_capacity
    
    # Initialize the potential value matrix
    potential_value_matrix = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Node partitioning: Identify the nodes with the highest demand
    high_demand_nodes = normalized_demands > 0.1  # threshold can be adjusted
    
    # Demand relaxation: Reduce the demand for high-demand nodes
    relaxed_demands = torch.where(high_demand_nodes, demands * 0.9, demands)
    
    # Path decomposition: Compute the potential value for each edge
    for i in range(distance_matrix.size(0)):
        for j in range(distance_matrix.size(1)):
            if i != j:  # Exclude the depot node from the calculation
                # Calculate the potential value for edge (i, j)
                potential_value = relaxed_demands[i] + relaxed_demands[j] - demands[i] - demands[j]
                # Update the potential value matrix
                potential_value_matrix[i, j] = potential_value
    
    # Apply an explicit potential value heuristic for direct potential value calculation
    # The heuristic assigns negative values to undesirable edges and positive values to promising ones
    # Here we use a simple heuristic where we subtract the potential value from the distance
    heuristic_matrix = distance_matrix - potential_value_matrix
