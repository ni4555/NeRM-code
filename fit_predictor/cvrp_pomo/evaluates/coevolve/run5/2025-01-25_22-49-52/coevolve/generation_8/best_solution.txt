Description:
The problem description is as follows:

Develop an advanced heuristic for the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) that minimizes route distances while strictly adhering to vehicle capacities. This heuristic should integrate constraint programming with dynamic window approaches and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to efficiently solve complex routing challenges. The algorithm must incorporate node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition techniques to optimize route selection. It should be capable of real-time adaptation to dynamic changes in problem instances, such as varying node demands and vehicle capacities. The solution should prioritize the minimization of route distances, maintain optimal vehicle load balancing, and ensure robust performance even in the face of real-time updates and constraints.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the heuristic values based on the normalized demands
    # We will use a simple heuristic: the negative of the demand (lower demand is better)
    # This is a demand relaxation approach, which is a common heuristic for capacitated VRP
    heuristic_matrix = -normalized_demands

    # Incorporate dynamic window approach by adding a penalty for longer distances
    # This can be done by subtracting the distance matrix from a constant (e.g., max distance)
    max_distance = distance_matrix.max().item()
    heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix - distance_matrix

    # Incorporate path decomposition by adding a penalty for edges that exceed a certain threshold
    # This is a simplistic approach, and more sophisticated methods can be used depending on the problem
    threshold = 0.5 * max_distance
    heuristic_matrix[distance_matrix > threshold] += distance_matrix[distance_matrix > threshold]

    return heuristic_matrix
