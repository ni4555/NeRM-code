Description:
Develop a sophisticated solution algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), targeting a minimization of route distances while ensuring vehicle capacities are adhered to strictly. Focus on the implementation of exact or heuristic methods that can effectively integrate constraint programming, dynamic window approaches, or multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to tackle complex routing challenges efficiently. Incorporate techniques like node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition to optimize route selection, with an emphasis on real-time adaptation and robust performance for dynamic problem instances.

Code:
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Normalize distance matrix
    max_distance = distance_matrix.max().item()
    normalized_distances = distance_matrix / max_distance
    
    # Normalize demands
    max_demand = demands.max().item()
    normalized_demands = demands / max_demand
    
    # Calculate the potential value for each edge
    # Here, we use a simple heuristic that combines distance and demand
    potential_values = normalized_distances - normalized_demands
    
    # Set the depot to 0 potential value
    potential_values[0, :] = 0
    potential_values[:, 0] = 0
    
    return potential_values
