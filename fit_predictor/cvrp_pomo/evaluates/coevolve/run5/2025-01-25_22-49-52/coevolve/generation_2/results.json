  "description": "Develop an innovative heuristic for the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (DCVRP) that emphasizes the minimization of route distances while strictly adhering to vehicle capacities. This heuristic should leverage a hybrid approach, combining constraint programming with dynamic window techniques and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to address intricate routing challenges effectively. By incorporating advanced methods like node partitioning, demand relaxation, and path decomposition, the heuristic will optimize route selection. It must be capable of real-time adaptation to dynamic problem instances, where customer demands and vehicle capacities are subject to change, and must exhibit robustness across diverse conditions. The heuristic should prioritize distance minimization, optimize vehicle load balancing, and maintain constraint satisfaction while ensuring rapid response and scalability.",
