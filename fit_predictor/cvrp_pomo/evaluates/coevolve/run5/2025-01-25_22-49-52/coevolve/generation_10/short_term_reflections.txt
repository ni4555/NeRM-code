Key elements guided better performance:
- Clear performance measure (minimize route distances)
- Explicit method integration (constraint programming, dynamic window, MEEA)
- Emphasis on dynamic adaptation and robustness

Constrained aspects of the worse description:
- Ambiguous performance measure
- Overreliance on complex methods without specifics
- Lack of dynamic adaptation and real-time constraints

Algorithmic insights from better description:
- Normalization for distance and demand (scale problem space)
- Simplified potential calculation (combine attributes)
- Focus on depot as a central reference point

Better description hints:
Clarity, performance measures, method specifics, dynamic adaptability, robustness.
1. Clarity on problem specifics, e.g., exact distance matrix, demand normalization.
2. Avoid vague terms like "advanced," "dynamic window," and "multi-objective."
3. Specify algorithmic techniques, e.g., "normalize," "partition," "relax demands."
Key elements: Normalize inputs, use potential heuristic.

Misled aspects: Strict constraint adherence, no emphasis on adaptation.

Insights: Better description allowed for more flexible heuristic development.

Design hints:
- Emphasize flexibility in constraints.
- Include specific heuristics used.
- Mention performance goals and trade-offs.
1. Specify normalization for distance and demand.
2. Clarify the heuristic's objective and constraints.
3. Emphasize specific algorithmic components (e.g., path decomposition).
4. Mention integration of algorithms (e.g., constraint programming).
