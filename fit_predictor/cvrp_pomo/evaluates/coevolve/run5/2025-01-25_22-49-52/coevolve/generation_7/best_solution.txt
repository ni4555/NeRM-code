Description:
Design a sophisticated hybrid optimization framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that prioritizes route efficiency under stringent capacity constraints. This approach combines an enhanced Genetic Algorithm (GA) with advanced local search methods, including a state-of-the-art Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for fine-tuning. The framework initializes with a robust node partitioning strategy to ensure a strong starting solution, and incorporates demand relaxation to accommodate dynamic changes. By normalizing distance and demand metrics, the heuristic function computes a tailored potential value to steer the GA's exploration. The hybridization process begins with a node partitioning and demand relaxation phase, followed by extensive GA exploration and SA-based iterative refinement to achieve a delicate balance between solution diversity and optimization quality.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Compute the potential value for each edge
    # Here we use a simple heuristic: the potential value is the negative of the distance
    # and we add a positive term proportional to the normalized demand
    potential_value = -distance_matrix + normalized_demands * 10.0

    # The heuristic function returns the potential value for each edge
    return potential_value
