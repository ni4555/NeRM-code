1. Integrate diverse heuristics, adapt dynamically, and balance objectives.
2. Simplify complex functions, focus on edge-specific features, and normalize inputs.
3. Use penalties for constraints, demand relaxation, and proximity-based adjustments.
4. Incorporate domain knowledge, balance weights, and optimize for exploration-exploitation.
5. Leverage demand variance, avoid redundancy, and vectorize for efficiency.
