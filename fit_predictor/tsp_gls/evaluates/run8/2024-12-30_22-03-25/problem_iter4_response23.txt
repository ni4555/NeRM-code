    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Avoiding division by zero by adding a small constant
    heuristic_matrix = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)
    
    # Apply a logarithmic transformation to penalize long distances more heavily
    # and to ensure the matrix remains non-negative
    return np.log(heuristic_matrix + 1e-8)
