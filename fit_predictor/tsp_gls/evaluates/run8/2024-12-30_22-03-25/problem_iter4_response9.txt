```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    # Subtract the minimum edge for each pair from the original distance
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
    # It's bad to include long edges that are not the shortest path
    return distance_matrix - 2 * min_distances + np.diag(np.ones(n))
```
