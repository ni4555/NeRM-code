```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Use a creative heuristic: consider the sum of the distances from each node to the next node
    # as a measure of how bad it is to include that edge
    return np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=0) + np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1)
```
