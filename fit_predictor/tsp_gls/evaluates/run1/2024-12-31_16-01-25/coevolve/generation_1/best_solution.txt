Description:
Innovative Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solution via Adaptive Guided Local Search. Utilize a hybrid optimization framework integrating simulated annealing with path-swapping metaheuristics to explore diverse topologies and exploit local neighborhood structures. Leverage adaptive parameter tuning for dynamic search efficiency, while incorporating constraint-driven pruning to reduce computational complexity. Employ multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to foster diversity and refine solutions through iterative mutation and crossover. Integrate constraint programming techniques to ensure adherence to distance constraints and enhance overall path quality.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Assuming the distance_matrix is a square matrix with distances between cities
    # Initialize the heuristics array with the same shape as the distance_matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Implement your heuristics here
    # This is a placeholder for the actual heuristic implementation
    # For example, a simple heuristic could be the inverse of the distance
    heuristics = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-10)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    return heuristics
