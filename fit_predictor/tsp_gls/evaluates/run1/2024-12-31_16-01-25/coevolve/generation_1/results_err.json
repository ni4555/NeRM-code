  "description": "Innovative Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solution via Adaptive Guided Local Search. Utilize a hybrid optimization framework integrating simulated annealing with path-swapping metaheuristics to explore diverse topologies and exploit local neighborhood structures. Leverage adaptive parameter tuning for dynamic search efficiency, while incorporating constraint-driven pruning to reduce computational complexity. Employ multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to foster diversity and refine solutions through iterative mutation and crossover. Integrate constraint programming techniques to ensure adherence to distance constraints and enhance overall path quality.",
