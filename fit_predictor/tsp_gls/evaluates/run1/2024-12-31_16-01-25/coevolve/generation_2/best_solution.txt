Description:
Innovative TSP resolution through a synergistic blend of adaptive guided local search and state-of-the-art metaheuristics. This approach leverages the power of simulated annealing and path-swapping algorithms to effectively traverse diverse solution landscapes while capitalizing on local neighborhood structures. Advanced adaptive parameter tuning mechanisms are employed to maximize search efficiency and minimize computational load through constraint-driven pruning techniques. Further enhancing the search, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm fosters diversity in the solution space, iteratively refines solutions via mutation and crossover operations, and ensures adherence to distance constraints with the aid of constraint programming. This comprehensive strategy aspires to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.617516362484723, yielding superior TSP solutions.
