Description:
The TSP is addressed through a hybrid algorithm that synergistically blends adaptive guided local search with state-of-the-art metaheuristics like simulated annealing and path-swapping. This method harnesses the potential of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to foster diversity in the solution space, continually enhancing solutions via innovative mutation and crossover mechanisms. The algorithm optimally utilizes both the Manhattan distance heuristic and the direct application of the distance matrix for efficient traversal of diverse solution landscapes. Advanced adaptive parameter tuning and constraint-driven pruning strategies are incorporated to maximize computational efficiency and surpass a fitness threshold of 10.60242549294038, yielding superior TSP solutions through a balanced approach that optimizes both local neighborhood structures and global search efficiency, ensuring a robust and scalable solution framework.
