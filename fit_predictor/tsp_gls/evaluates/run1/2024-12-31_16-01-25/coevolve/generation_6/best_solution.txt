Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is solved using a sophisticated algorithm that synergistically merges adaptive guided local search with cutting-edge metaheuristics, including simulated annealing and path-swapping techniques. This integrated approach harnesses the strength of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to foster diversity in the solution space, utilizing mutation and crossover operations for iterative enhancement. By integrating the Manhattan distance heuristic with direct distance matrix usage as a heuristic, the algorithm efficiently navigates complex solution landscapes while adhering to distance constraints and optimizing computational efficiency. Enhanced by advanced adaptive parameter tuning and constraint-driven pruning, the implementation aims to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.60242549294038, delivering superior TSP solutions through a balanced combination of exploration and exploitation.
