1. Tailor heuristics to problem specifics, incorporating domain knowledge & multiple criteria.
2. Normalize values, exploit symmetry, and balance complexity for improved accuracy.
3. Focus on key elements, consider edge importance, and utilize local & global insights.
4. Base heuristics on meaningful features, normalize, and refine iteratively.
