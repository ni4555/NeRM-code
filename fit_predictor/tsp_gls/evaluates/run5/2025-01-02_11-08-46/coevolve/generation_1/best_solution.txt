Description:
Utilize a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, incorporating elements of guided local search, adaptive parameter tuning, and evolutionary computation. Emphasize the integration of neighborhood exploration, path diversity maintenance, and convergence criteria to achieve optimized solutions for TSP instances with varying node distributions and edge costs.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # This function is a simple heuristic that assumes lower distance values
    # indicate a better edge to include in a solution. This can be replaced
    # with more complex heuristics depending on the problem's requirements.

    # Calculate the maximum distance in the matrix to normalize the values
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    
    # Normalize the distance matrix to have values between 0 and 1
    normalized_matrix = distance_matrix / max_distance
    
    # Return the normalized matrix which acts as a heuristic indicator
    return normalized_matrix
