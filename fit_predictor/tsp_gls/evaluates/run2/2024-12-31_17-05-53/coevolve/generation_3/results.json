  "description": "Employ a synergistic evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, harmoniously integrating advanced adaptive neighborhood exploration with intelligent guided local search mechanisms. This comprehensive approach prioritizes the refinement of candidate solutions through adaptive neighborhood techniques, while concurrently harnessing the strategic insights of local search to navigate the fitness landscape effectively. By capitalizing on the strengths of both methods, this algorithm seeks to surpass the benchmark solution of 10.617516362484723, delivering enhanced optimization capabilities and surpassing traditional evolutionary strategies.",
