Description:
Employ a synergistic evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, which combines adaptive neighborhood exploration with intelligent guided local search mechanisms to enhance optimization capabilities. This hybrid approach integrates a comprehensive fitness landscape analysis with strategic insights from local search, leveraging both adaptive neighborhood techniques and global optimization opportunities. By harnessing the Manhattan distance calculations for heuristic guidance and exploiting the average distance for edge selection, the algorithm aims to refine candidate solutions and surpass the benchmark solution of 10.620527530439306, delivering superior optimization performance compared to traditional evolutionary strategies.
