  "description": "Utilize a hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, incorporating adaptive neighborhood exploration, fitness landscape analysis, and a guided local search strategy. This approach combines the exploitation of global optimization opportunities with a focus on effective local search techniques, aiming to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.617516362484723 by leveraging both a heuristic matrix for edge prioritization and a dynamic strategy for neighborhood exploration.",
