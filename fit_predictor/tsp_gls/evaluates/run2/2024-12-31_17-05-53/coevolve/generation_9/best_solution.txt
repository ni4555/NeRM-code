Description:
Integrate an innovative hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the TSP, which seamlessly combines dynamic neighborhood traversal, strategic guided local search, and an in-depth analysis of the fitness terrain. This cutting-edge method incorporates a highly refined heuristic matrix for edge selection enhancement, adaptively refines neighborhood exploration techniques, and synergizes global and local optimization efforts. By applying Manhattan distance metrics for heuristic guidance, integrating the average edge distance for optimal selection, and navigating the fitness landscape with exceptional accuracy, the algorithm aspires to exceed the existing benchmark of 10.621717258445745, achieving exceptional optimization efficiency and outpacing traditional evolutionary algorithms.
