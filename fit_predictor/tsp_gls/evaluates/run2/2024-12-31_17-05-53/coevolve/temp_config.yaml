description: Integrate an innovative hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the TSP, which
  seamlessly combines dynamic neighborhood traversal, strategic guided local search,
  and an in-depth analysis of the fitness terrain. This cutting-edge method incorporates
  a highly refined heuristic matrix for edge selection enhancement, adaptively refines
  neighborhood exploration techniques, and synergizes global and local optimization
  efforts. By applying Manhattan distance metrics for heuristic guidance, integrating
  the average edge distance for optimal selection, and navigating the fitness landscape
  with exceptional accuracy, the algorithm aspires to exceed the existing benchmark
  of 10.621717258445745, achieving exceptional optimization efficiency and outpacing
  traditional evolutionary algorithms.
