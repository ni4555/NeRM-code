Consider edge penalties, non-linear transformations, and problem-specific features.
Avoid oversimplification, consider node context, balance penalties, and encourage diversity.
1. Focus on specific problem attributes.
2. Use global penalties for strong guiding.
3. Keep heuristics simple for efficiency.
4. Measure loop quality relative to direct distance.
Balance direct and loop penalties, use context-aware metrics, encourage diversity, and refine with additional constraints.
Use diverse components, balance factors, and emphasize unique features.
1. Localize penalties, use context-aware metrics.
2. Customize penalties for different parts of the problem.
3. Introduce diversity to avoid local optima.
4. Penalize common configurations to encourage exploration.
- Balance direct and indirect penalties.
- Use context-specific metrics for scaling.
- Consider connectivity and diversity promotion.
- Integrate weighted sums or weighted averages.
Focus on the problem's structure. Use distance comparisons, encourage diversity, balance penalties, and be context-aware.
Utilize domain knowledge, iterate, and refine weights.
Combine metrics, balance weights, use relative measures, and limit extremes.
