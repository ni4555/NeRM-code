Use median for large distance penalties and node frequency for diversity.
Improve heuristic accuracy with more sophisticated distance considerations, incorporating loop length, direct distance, common structures, and diversity.
Avoid redundant calculations, use direct differences, and minimize complexity.
Adapt penalties based on relative distances, use median for scale, encourage diversity with normalization.
Balance penalties, normalize using min, structure for connectivity, diversity for sparsity.
1. Focus on relative penalties for consistency.
2. Use factors and scales for modularity.
3. Normalize for global context and structure.
4. Promote diversity with frequency-based penalties.
5. Include global goals to guide exploration.
Utilize structure in penalties, consider minimum distance context, and promote diversity.
Use domain knowledge, avoid redundant computations, leverage statistics, and balance incentives.
Focus on direct effects, minimize complexity, normalize penalties, and exploit substructures.
1. Focus on single objectives.
2. Normalize penalties to better represent relative edge quality.
3. Consider simple dominance rules to easily assess edge preference.
4. Use context to assess more than immediate neighbors.
5. Avoid overpenalizing common or essential edges.
6. Promote diversity by penalizing common edge combinations.
