  description: 'Task: Given an edge distance matrix and a current local optimal route
    for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), design and implement a dynamic heuristic
    strategy to update the edge distances. The strategy should be informed by the
    provided Python function, which takes into account the usage of each edge and
    adjusts distances to avoid local minima. The performance of this heuristic should
    be evaluated based on a fitness value of 3.55741. The goal is to iteratively refine
    the route, progressively moving towards a global optimal tour with the minimized
    total distance.'
