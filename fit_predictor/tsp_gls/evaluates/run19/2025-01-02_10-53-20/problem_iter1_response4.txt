```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Introduce a penalty for high degree vertices
    # A vertex with a high degree will be penalized to encourage using other routes
    degree_penalty = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=0) ** 2
    # Introduce a reward for short paths
    # Short paths will be rewarded to encourage using them in the solution
    short_path_reward = np.log(distance_matrix + 1)
    # Combine both penalties and rewards to get the heuristic values
    return degree_penalty - short_path_reward
