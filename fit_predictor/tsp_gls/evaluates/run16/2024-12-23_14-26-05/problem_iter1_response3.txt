```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the degree of each node
    degrees = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=0)
    
    # Calculate the centrality based on the degree
    centrality = 1 / (degrees + 1e-5)  # Adding a small value to avoid division by zero
    
    # Use centrality as the heuristic value
    return centrality
