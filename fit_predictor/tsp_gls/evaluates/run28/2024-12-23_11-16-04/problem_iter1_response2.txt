```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create a matrix where each cell is the sum of the distances to all other nodes
    total_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=0)
    # The heuristic is the negative sum of distances from each node to all others
    # Longer distances contribute more negatively, which encourages short paths
    return -total_distances
