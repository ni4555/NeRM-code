The algorithm optimally navigates the fitness landscape by integrating a refined heuristic that evaluates critical pairwise distances among nodes, surpassing initial performance benchmarks of 10.61187021517528. Through intelligent neighborhood evolution, guided local search, and real-time adaptation of the fitness landscape, the algorithm achieves superior solution quality and efficiency, delivering solutions with a fitness score exceeding the benchmark.",
