  "description": "Revolutionary TSP Algorithm via Integrated Metaheuristic and Adaptive Heuristic Fusion: This innovative method synergizes cutting-edge metaheuristic strategies with an adaptive heuristic for dynamic path selection, enhancing exploration and exploitation in real-time. By implementing an intelligent neighborhood evolution mechanism and an enhanced guided local search technique, the algorithm optimally navigates the fitness landscape, leveraging advanced pairwise distance evaluation to surpass existing benchmarks, delivering superior solution quality and efficiency.",
