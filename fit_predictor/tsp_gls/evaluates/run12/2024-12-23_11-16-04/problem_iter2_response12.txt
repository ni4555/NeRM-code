```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the minimum distance from each node to any other node
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # Calculate the relative difference between each edge's distance and the minimum distance
    relative_differences = (distance_matrix - min_distances) / min_distances
    # It's bad to include edges that have a large relative difference
    return relative_differences
