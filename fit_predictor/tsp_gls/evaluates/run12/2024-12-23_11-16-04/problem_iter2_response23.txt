```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the minimum distance from each node to the farthest node
    max_distances = np.max(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # It's bad to include edges that are significantly shorter than the maximum distance
    return max_distances - distance_matrix
```
