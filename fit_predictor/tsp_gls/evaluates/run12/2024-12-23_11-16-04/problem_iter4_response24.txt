```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # Use relative distances and normalize to the range [0, 1]
    normalized_distances = distance_matrix / min_distances
    # Use a simple normalization that avoids large values and promotes balance
    return (normalized_distances - 1) / (1 - min(normalized_distances))
```
