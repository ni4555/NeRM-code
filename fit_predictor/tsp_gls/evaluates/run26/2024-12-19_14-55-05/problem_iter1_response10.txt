```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges and it's even worse if they are surrounded by shorter edges
    badness = np.where(distance_matrix > distance_matrix.mean(), distance_matrix, 0)
    return np.where(badness.mean(axis=1) + badness.mean(axis=0) > badness.mean(), badness, 0)
```
