```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges in the solution, but also consider the neighborhood
    # Calculate the average distance from each node to all other nodes
    avg_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1) / (distance_matrix.shape[1] - 1)
    # Add a penalty for long edges, but also for being far from the average
    return distance_matrix + (avg_distances - distance_matrix) ** 2
```
