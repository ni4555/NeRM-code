```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the minimum distance from each node to any other node
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # Calculate the average distance from each node to all other nodes
    avg_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1) / (distance_matrix.shape[1] - 1)
    # Penalize edges that are significantly longer than the minimum distance
    # and edges that are far from the average distance
    return distance_matrix - min_distances - (avg_distances - distance_matrix) * 0.5
