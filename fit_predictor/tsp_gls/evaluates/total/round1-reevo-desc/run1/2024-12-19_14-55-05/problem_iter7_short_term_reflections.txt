Penalize distances directly, enhance with diversity metrics, and detect common structures.
Incorporate global constraints, normalize penalties, and discourage infeasible structures.
- Incentivize short paths over loops
- Utilize connectivity to encourage diversity
- Apply direct penalties for undesirable patterns
- Refine penalties to balance exploration and exploitation
Focus on edge penalties, enhance diversity, and use local structure recognition.
Incorporate penalties for suboptimal structures, prioritize structural penalties over absolute values, and use relative distances to mitigate scale dependency.
Consider balance, relative distance, diversity, and exploration in heuristic design.
Incorporate a balance factor for different penalties, introduce diversity, and use global penalties to encourage exploration.
1. Consider context and penalties for frequently visited paths.
2. Introduce trade-offs between different penalties.
3. Incorporate local and global information.
4. Encourage diversity to avoid local optima.
5. Use meaningful metric combinations.
1. Incorporate direct distance penalties based on edge length.
2. Use loop diversity to avoid overlapping cycles.
3. Normalize to a uniform scale for better comparison.
4. Apply aggressive penalties for overly large or common edges.
5. Avoid self-loops; they are unnecessary for cost.
1. Simplicity is key: Use a single criterion with intuitive meaning.
2. Focus on fundamental quality measure (loop length).
3. Avoid complexity in edge frequency and balance terms.
4. Specify thresholds clearly to avoid overpenalizing.
5. Limit the number of heuristics to ensure focus and clarity.
