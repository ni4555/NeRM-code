```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Consider the degree of connectivity of each node
    degree = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # Higher degree suggests a more central node, potentially a worse candidate to include in the solution
    return 1 / (degree + 1)
```
