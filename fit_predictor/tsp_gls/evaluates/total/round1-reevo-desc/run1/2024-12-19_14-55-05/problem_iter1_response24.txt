```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the heuristic values as the negative of the logarithm of the distances
    # Longer distances will have smaller negative values, indicating lower priority to include the edge
    return -np.log(distance_matrix)
```
