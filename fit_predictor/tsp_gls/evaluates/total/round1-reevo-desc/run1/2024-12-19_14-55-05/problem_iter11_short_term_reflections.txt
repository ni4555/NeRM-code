1. Focus on key interactions.
2. Introduce structural penalties.
3. Use diversity incentives.
4. Normalize for consistency.
5. Avoid overpenalization.
Incorporate problem-specific insights, balance multi-objectives, and refine normalization.
Consider:
- Introduce penalties for loops and large distances.
- Use relative metrics for normalization.
- Implement frequency-based diversity and balance penalties.
Integrate global penalties, use relative distances, normalize for diversity, and ensure non-negativity.
- Incorporate loop penalties relative to direct distances.
- Normalize by reference distance, not domain max.
- Promote diversity with frequency adjustments.
- Consider edge implications, not just pairwise metrics.
1. Use statistical measures (median) to avoid overly sensitive heuristics.
2. Incorporate the concept of edge frequency to encourage diversity.
3. Normalize penalties to avoid overpowering local heuristics.
4. Regularize constraints to avoid trivial local optima.
Consider the following hints for heuristic design:

- Use global factors relative to matrix characteristics.
- Incorporate direct and indirect penalties.
- Reflect edge frequency and node diversity.
- Normalize to non-negative values.
1. Use robust statistical measures like medians for normalization.
2. Apply edge-specific penalties based on context (e.g., loop lengths vs direct distances).
3. Consider edge frequency and diversify based on common structures.
Adapt penalties to global min, encourage diverse paths, and normalize to non-negative.
- Focus on meaningful edge penalties.
- Use global properties for effective diversification.
- Minimize complexity in implementation.
- Normalize penalties to encode preference strength.
- penalize self-loops and over-expressed connections.
