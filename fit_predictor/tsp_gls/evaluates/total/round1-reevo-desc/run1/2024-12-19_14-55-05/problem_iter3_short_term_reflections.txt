Incorporate domain-specific penalties, like length and self-loops.
Incorporate domain-specific knowledge, use multiple features, and penalize riskier moves.
Emphasize relative distances, use absolute deviations, consider symmetry, avoid unnecessary penalties.
Incorporate meaningful information, balance with variability, and consider higher-order features.
Consider the problem's constraints, weight penalties appropriately, and local context for each edge.
Account for diversity and relative cost, use domain-specific distance metrics, and incorporate penalties for undesirable configurations.
Simplify heuristic design, focus on potential gains, and normalize rewards.
technical insight, structural penalty, global optimization awareness
Evaluate edge significance relative to context, apply weighted penalties, consider statistical measures.
Consider accuracy over simplicity, incorporate relevant spatial metrics, and tailor to the problem domain.
