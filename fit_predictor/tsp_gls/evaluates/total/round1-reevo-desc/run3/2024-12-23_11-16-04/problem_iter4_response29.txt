```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the minimum distance from each node to any other node
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # It's bad to include edges that are significantly longer than the minimum distance
    # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    return distance_matrix - min_distances + 1e-6
```
