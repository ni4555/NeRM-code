```python

    # Calculate the total distance of the longest shortest path cycle
    longest_cycle = np.sort(distance_matrix.sum(axis=0))[-2]
    
    # It's bad to include edges that are part of the longest shortest path cycle
    return np.where(distance_matrix == longest_cycle, -np.inf, distance_matrix)
