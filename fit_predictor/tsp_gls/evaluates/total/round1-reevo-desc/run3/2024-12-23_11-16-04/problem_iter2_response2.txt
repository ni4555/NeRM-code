```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    # Use relative distance measures, favor edges closer to the node's minimum distance
    relative_distances = distance_matrix / min_distances
    # Avoid complex penalties and keep the measure simple
    return relative_distances
```
