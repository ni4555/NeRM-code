```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # This heuristic assumes that the closer two nodes are, the less likely they are to be in the same path.
    # It creates a matrix where the value at each cell is inversely proportional to the distance.
    return 1.0 / (distance_matrix + 1e-10)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero.
