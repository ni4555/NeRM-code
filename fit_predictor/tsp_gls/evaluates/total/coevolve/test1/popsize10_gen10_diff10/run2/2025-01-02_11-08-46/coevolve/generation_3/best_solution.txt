Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is tackled using an advanced hybrid algorithm that synergistically combines guided local search with evolutionary strategies. This method incorporates an enhanced heuristic function, incorporating both distance-based normalization and a robust minimum sum heuristic for optimal edge selection. Emphasis is placed on diverse neighborhood exploration to foster path variation, alongside adaptive parameter tuning for dynamic search efficiency. The algorithm employs advanced convergence criteria to guarantee optimal or near-optimal results, aiming for a fitness score surpassing 10.60242549294038. This comprehensive approach harmonizes the strengths of guided local search and evolutionary computation to optimize the TSP solution space.

    min_sum_matrix = np.tile(min_sum, (len(min_sum), 1))
    min_sum_matrix = np.abs(distance_matrix - min_sum_matrix)
    
    # Combine the two components
    combined_heuristics = normalized_matrix + min_sum_matrix
    
    # Apply a smoothing function to avoid extremely high heuristics
    smoothed_heuristics = np.clip(combined_heuristics, 0, 1)
