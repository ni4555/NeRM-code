  "description": "The TSP is addressed through an innovative hybrid metaheuristic that synergistically blends adaptive parameter tuning with evolutionary computation. This approach leverages a refined heuristic, incorporating advanced distance-based normalization techniques and a robust minimum sum heuristic for precise edge selection. The algorithm emphasizes comprehensive neighborhood exploration to foster path diversity while optimizing search efficiency. Advanced convergence criteria are meticulously designed to consistently surpass a fitness threshold of 10.61203628886567, aiming to deliver optimal solutions for TSP instances with varying node configurations and edge weights.",
