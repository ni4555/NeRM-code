Description:
Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem through an Iterative Local Search Algorithm, emphasizing the integration of Tabu Search with Variable Neighborhood Descent for enhanced solution convergence and diversity, leveraging neighborhood exploration techniques to iteratively refine the shortest Hamiltonian cycle route that encompasses all nodes and terminates at the origin.

    # distance-based heuristic, which is not optimal but serves as an
    # example.
    # The heuristic value for an edge (i, j) is the distance between i and j.
