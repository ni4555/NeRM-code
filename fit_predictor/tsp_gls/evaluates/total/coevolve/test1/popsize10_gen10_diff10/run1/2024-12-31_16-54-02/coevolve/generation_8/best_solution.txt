Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is tackled with an advanced guided local search strategy that integrates a dynamic local search with an innovative heuristic for edge distance computation. This approach employs a shortest path algorithm to prevent node revisits, ensuring a continuous and seamless route. To optimize solutions, the algorithm synergistically merges Tabu Search with adaptive Variable Neighborhood Descent, utilizing diverse neighborhood structures for iterative convergence on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle. A refined heuristic algorithm calculates the shortest path between any two nodes without looping back to the origin, aiming to surpass a solution quality of 10.608508827174282 by reaching a termination threshold, thereby guaranteeing exceptional route optimization.

    # with zeros, which represents the initial heuristic value for each edge.

    # Compute the shortest path between any two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm
    # and fill the heuristic_matrix with the computed shortest path distances.
