Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is solved with an enhanced guided local search approach that incorporates a dynamic local search strategy and a sophisticated heuristic for edge distance computation. This method leverages a shortest path algorithm to prevent node revisits, ensuring a seamless route. To optimize solutions, the algorithm synergistically merges Tabu Search with adaptive Variable Neighborhood Descent, utilizing various neighborhood structures for iterative convergence towards the optimal Hamiltonian cycle. A refined heuristic algorithm calculates the shortest path between any two nodes without looping back to the origin, aiming to surpass a solution quality of 10.613564951942134 by reaching a termination threshold, thereby guaranteeing exceptional route optimization.
