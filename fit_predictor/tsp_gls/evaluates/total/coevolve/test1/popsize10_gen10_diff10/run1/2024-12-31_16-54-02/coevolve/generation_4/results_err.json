  "description": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is addressed using a guided local search strategy that optimizes the shortest path traversal of all given nodes, returning to the starting node. This approach leverages a combination of dynamic local search techniques and innovative heuristics for edge distance computation, while integrating Tabu Search and Variable Neighborhood Descent to explore diverse neighborhood structures. The algorithm iteratively converges on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle, surpassing a solution quality threshold of 10.611581849129063 by dynamically avoiding revisiting nodes and refining the route through adaptive strategies.",
