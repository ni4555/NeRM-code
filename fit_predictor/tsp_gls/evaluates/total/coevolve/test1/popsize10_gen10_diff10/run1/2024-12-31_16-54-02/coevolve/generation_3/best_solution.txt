Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is addressed using an advanced guided local search approach that combines a dynamic local search strategy with an innovative heuristic for edge distance computation. This method employs a shortest path algorithm to avoid revisiting nodes, ensuring a continuous route. To further optimize the solution, the algorithm synergistically integrates Tabu Search with an adaptive Variable Neighborhood Descent, leveraging diverse neighborhood structures for iterative convergence on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle. The combined strategy aims to achieve solution quality surpassing 10.596621379960432 through a termination threshold, ensuring unparalleled route optimization.

    # distance to the nearest node in the matrix.
