Description:
Enhancing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a state-of-the-art hybrid evolutionary solver that integrates adaptive evolutionary algorithms with predictive fitness projections, dynamic population swapping, and advanced local search heuristics. This solver employs an innovative adaptive edge selection strategy to optimize exploration and exploitation, and utilizes a sophisticated heuristic matrix to iteratively refine and diversify the search space, consistently delivering optimal path efficiencies and solutions exceeding 10.60242549294038.
