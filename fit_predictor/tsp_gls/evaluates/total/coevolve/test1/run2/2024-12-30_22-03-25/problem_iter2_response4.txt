```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create a heuristic matrix based on the inverse of the distance
    # Avoiding division by zero by adding a small constant
    heuristic_matrix = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-8)
    
    # Incorporate more information by reducing the influence of high distances
    # Use a logarithmic transformation to avoid having to deal with very high numbers
    # and to penalize long distances more heavily
    return np.log(heuristic_matrix + 1)
```
