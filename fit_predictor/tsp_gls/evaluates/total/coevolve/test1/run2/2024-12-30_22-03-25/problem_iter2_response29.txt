```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Improved heuristic that combines aspects of both previous approaches
    # We use the average distance between each node and all other nodes
    # as a measure of how "expensive" it is to include any edge in the solution
    average_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    return 1 / (average_distances + 1e-8)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
```
