  "description": "Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) through a hybrid local search algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with simulated annealing. The goal is to discover an efficient path that traverses all nodes, visiting each exactly once, and returns to the origin, minimizing the total distance traveled. This approach emphasizes adaptive parameter tuning, multi-criteria optimization, and iterative refinement of candidate solutions to ensure convergence towards the global optimum.",
