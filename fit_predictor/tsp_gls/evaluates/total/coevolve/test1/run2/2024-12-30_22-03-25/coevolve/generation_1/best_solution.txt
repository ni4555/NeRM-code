Description:
Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) through a hybrid local search algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with simulated annealing. The goal is to discover an efficient path that traverses all nodes, visiting each exactly once, and returns to the origin, minimizing the total distance traveled. This approach emphasizes adaptive parameter tuning, multi-criteria optimization, and iterative refinement of candidate solutions to ensure convergence towards the global optimum.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Assuming a simple heuristic: the distance of each edge is its heuristic score
    # In a real-world application, this could be more complex depending on the TSP variant and problem specifics.
    return distance_matrix
