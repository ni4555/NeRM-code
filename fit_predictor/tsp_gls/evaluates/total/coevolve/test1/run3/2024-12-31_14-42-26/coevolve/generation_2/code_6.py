def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # This function calculates heuristics based on the distance matrix.
    # The actual implementation would depend on the specific metaheuristic and adaptive heuristic strategies.
    # Since the exact method is not provided, a placeholder is used.
    # For demonstration purposes, let's assume we're using a simple heuristic based on the distance:
    return -distance_matrix  # Negative because we're optimizing for a smaller value
