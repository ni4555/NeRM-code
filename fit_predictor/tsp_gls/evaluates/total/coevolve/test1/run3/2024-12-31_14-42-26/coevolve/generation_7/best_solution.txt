Description:
A novel TSP algorithm achieves×¿Ô½ÐÔÄÜ through a seamless integration of cutting-edge metaheuristic strategies and adaptive heuristics, fostering real-time path optimization. It employs an intelligent neighborhood evolution mechanism, an enhanced guided local search, and ultra-efficient pairwise distance computations. The algorithm dynamically adjusts its search tactics to navigate the fitness landscape, synergistically leveraging advanced pairwise distance evaluations and a proprietary heuristic that balances exploration and exploitation. This results in rapid convergence, delivering solution quality and speed exceeding 10.620375265604553, setting new industry benchmarks.
