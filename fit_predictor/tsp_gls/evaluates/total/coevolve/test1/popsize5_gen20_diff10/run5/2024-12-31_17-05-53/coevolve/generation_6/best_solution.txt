Description:
Integrate a synergistic evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, incorporating adaptive neighborhood exploration, guided local search, and thorough fitness landscape analysis. This innovative algorithm harnesses Manhattan distance metrics for strategic solution navigation and employs edge selection based on the average distance to enhance candidate quality. By harmoniously blending these advanced techniques, the algorithm aspires to exceed the existing benchmark of 10.620527530439306, achieving exceptional optimization performance through a refined global search and efficient local exploitation.

    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate the average distance for each edge
