Description:
Utilize a novel hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which synergistically combines adaptive neighborhood exploration with a comprehensive analysis of the fitness landscape. This approach incorporates an advanced heuristic matrix for optimizing edge selection, continuously evolves neighborhood exploration tactics, and leverages a combination of global and local optimization strategies. By navigating the fitness landscape with precision and utilizing both exploration and exploitation techniques, the algorithm aims to surpass the current benchmark of 10.610078466245126, achieving unparalleled optimization efficiency and outperforming conventional evolutionary algorithms.

    # Placeholder for the actual heuristic computation
    # For the sake of example, we'll use the distance matrix itself.
    # This is not a meaningful heuristic in real applications.
    
    # We could, for instance, use a more complex heuristic that
    # incorporates other parameters such as edge length or some
    # additional information that might be available.
    
    # For instance, we might calculate the average distance from the
    # start node to each node in the distance matrix, and then
    # add this value to the corresponding edge weight to form the heuristic.
    
    # This is a purely illustrative calculation and does not necessarily
    # improve the quality of the heuristic for the TSP.
