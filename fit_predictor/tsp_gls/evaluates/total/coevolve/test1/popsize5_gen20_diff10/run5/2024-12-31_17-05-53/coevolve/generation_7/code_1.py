    # This is a placeholder for the heuristics function implementation.
    # The actual implementation would depend on the specifics of the heuristics used,
    # which may include a combination of techniques like nearest neighbor, minimum spanning tree,
    # or more sophisticated methods that analyze the fitness landscape.
    
    # Example heuristic: a simple nearest neighbor heuristic where the heuristic value
    # of an edge is inversely proportional to its distance.
    return 1.0 / (distance_matrix + 1e-10)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero

# The following is an example of how the heuristics_v2 function might be used:
# Assuming `dist_matrix` is a precomputed distance matrix of shape (n, n)
# where `n` is the number of cities in the TSP problem.
# dist_matrix = np.random.rand(15, 15) * 100  # Example distance matrix
# heuristic_values = heuristics_v2(dist_matrix)
# print(heuristic_values)
