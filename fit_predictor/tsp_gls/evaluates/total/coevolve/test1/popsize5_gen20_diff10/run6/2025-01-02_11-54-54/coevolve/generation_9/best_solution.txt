Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem is effectively tackled by a hybrid algorithm that leverages both guided local search and a robust evolutionary approach. This synergy combines advanced tabu search methods, real-time adaptive parameter tuning, and an adaptive heuristic for edge cost estimation. By normalizing row distances through subtraction of the minimum distance and correlating with the graph's total cost, the algorithm optimizes travel routes, aiming to exceed a fitness threshold of 10.61187021517528 for unparalleled performance in intricate network structures.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Normalize row distances by subtracting the minimum distance in each row
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    normalized_distances = distance_matrix - min_distances
    
    # Correlate with the graph's total cost (sum of all row distances)
    total_cost = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    normalized_distances /= total_cost
    
    # Return the normalized distances as the heuristic values
    return normalized_distances
