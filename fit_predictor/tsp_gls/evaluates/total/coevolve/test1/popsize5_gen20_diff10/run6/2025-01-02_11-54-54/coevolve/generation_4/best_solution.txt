Description:
Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a hybrid evolutionary algorithm that integrates guided local search with tabu search strategies to improve exploration and exploitation. This approach combines adaptive parameter tuning for dynamic path optimization in complex network topologies, leveraging both a guided local search heuristic for initial solution generation and a refined tabu search mechanism to enhance the quality of solutions, aiming for improved fitness outcomes exceeding 10.61187021517528.
