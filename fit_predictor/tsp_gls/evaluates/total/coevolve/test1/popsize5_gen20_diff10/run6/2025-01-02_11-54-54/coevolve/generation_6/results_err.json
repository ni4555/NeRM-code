  "description": "Enhancing the Traveling Salesman Problem resolution through a synergistic evolutionary algorithm, merging intelligent local search techniques with tabu search mechanisms to foster both broad exploration and precise exploitation. This method employs real-time parameter adjustment to refine path calculations in intricate network configurations. By employing a heuristic-driven edge cost estimation system that correlates with the overall graph cost and normalizes row distances through subtraction of the minimum distance, the algorithm aspires to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.61187021517528, thereby optimizing travel routes with unparalleled efficiency.",
