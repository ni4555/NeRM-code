The algorithm employs an advanced heuristic based on a meticulously crafted distance matrix, which significantly enhances the quality of heuristic computation. By dynamically tuning its parameters in real-time, the solver leverages the speed of guided local search while maintaining intelligent adaptation, ultimately surpassing established fitness thresholds and delivering solutions with remarkable fitness values exceeding 10.619991632775594.",
