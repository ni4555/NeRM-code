Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem is tackled by an advanced hybrid optimization framework that synergistically integrates adaptive guided local search, simulated annealing, and path-swapping metaheuristics. This approach emphasizes the exploration of diverse topologies while efficiently exploiting local neighborhood structures. The solution is further refined through adaptive parameter tuning for enhanced search efficiency and constraint-driven pruning to reduce computational complexity. To maximize solution diversity and refine outcomes, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are fused with iterative mutation and crossover techniques. Additionally, the strategy incorporates constraint programming to ensure adherence to distance constraints and improve path quality. The proposed heuristic, a blend of distance-based heuristics and constraint programming, aims to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.617516362484723, thereby delivering superior solutions.

    # to any other node. This ratio penalizes longer edges more heavily.
