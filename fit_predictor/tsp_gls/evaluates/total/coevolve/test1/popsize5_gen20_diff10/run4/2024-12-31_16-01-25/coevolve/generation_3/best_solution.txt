Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is addressed through an advanced algorithmic approach that integrates adaptive guided local search with state-of-the-art metaheuristics, including simulated annealing and path-swapping algorithms. This comprehensive strategy harnesses the power of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to foster diversity in solution space, leveraging mutation and crossover operations for iterative refinement. By combining the Manhattan distance heuristic from the first description with the direct use of the distance matrix as a heuristic from the second, the algorithm efficiently navigates diverse solution landscapes while adhering to distance constraints and optimizing computational efficiency. The implementation incorporates advanced adaptive parameter tuning and constraint-driven pruning techniques, aiming to surpass the fitness threshold of 10.617516362484723 and deliver superior TSP solutions.
