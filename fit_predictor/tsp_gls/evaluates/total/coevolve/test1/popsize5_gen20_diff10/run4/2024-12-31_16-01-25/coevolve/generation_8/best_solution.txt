Description:
The innovative Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver employs a cutting-edge combination of adaptive guided local search, enhanced simulated annealing, and dynamic path-swapping heuristics. This hybrid solution leverages a robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with innovative mutation and crossover mechanisms, fostering a rich diversity of high-quality solutions. An advanced Manhattan distance heuristic optimizes solution exploration, ensuring compliance with distance constraints. The algorithm excels through intelligent adaptive parameter tuning and constraint-based pruning, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and consistently surpassing the fitness benchmark of 10.617516362484723, delivering unparalleled TSP performance.
