  "description": "Enhancing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a cutting-edge hybrid evolutionary algorithm, this approach seamlessly integrates a targeted local search with intelligent parameter tuning and adaptive neighborhood evolution. Utilizing a high-accuracy heuristic matrix for rapid distance evaluations, the algorithm surpasses the established threshold of 10.617516362484723 by employing heuristic-driven initialization, advanced mutation techniques, and adaptive selection mechanisms to optimize the search space and identify superior travel routes.",
