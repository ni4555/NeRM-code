def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # This is a placeholder for the actual heuristic implementation.
    # The implementation would depend on the specific heuristic you choose to use.
    # For example, one simple heuristic could be to use the maximum distance for each edge as a heuristic indicator.
    # In this case, the heuristic matrix would be the same as the distance matrix.

    # Here is an example of returning the same distance matrix as the heuristic:
    return distance_matrix.copy()
