  "description": "Our state-of-the-art TSP solver revolutionizes the problem-solving landscape through a hybrid evolutionary algorithm. This method ingeniously merges targeted local search with intelligent parameter tuning and adaptive neighborhood evolution, surpassing the previous benchmark of 10.617516362484723. The algorithm initiates with a robust heuristic-driven initialization, utilizing a high-accuracy heuristic matrix for rapid distance evaluations. It further enhances solution quality through sophisticated mutation and crossover techniques, as well as dynamic parameter optimization. The self-evolving adaptive neighborhood continually refines the search space, ensuring iterative improvement and selective evolution for delivering unparalleled travel route efficiency.",
