```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Add a penalty for long edges and for edges that would require backtracking (i.e., connecting a city with itself)
    return distance_matrix + np.maximum(0, distance_matrix ** 2) + 2 * np.maximum(0, distance_matrix.diagonal())
```
