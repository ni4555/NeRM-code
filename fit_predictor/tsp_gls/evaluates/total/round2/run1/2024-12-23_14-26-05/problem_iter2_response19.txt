```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Simplified approach: It's bad to include long edges in the solution
    # but not as simple as possible as the original better code
    # since it considers the actual distance matrix directly
    return 1 / (distance_matrix + 1)
```
