```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges in the solution
    # Additionally, encourage edges that can potentially improve the solution
    # by considering the average distance of the adjacent vertices
    row_avg = np.mean(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    col_avg = np.mean(distance_matrix, axis=0)
    return -distance_matrix + 0.1 * row_avg + 0.1 * col_avg
