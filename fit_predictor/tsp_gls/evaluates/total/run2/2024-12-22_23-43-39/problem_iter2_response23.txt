```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the minimum and maximum distance between all pairs of nodes
    min_distance = np.min(distance_matrix)
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    # Use the minimum and maximum distances as a relative heuristic
    # by scaling the actual distance to be a percentage of the max or min distance
    return (distance_matrix - min_distance) / (max_distance - min_distance)
