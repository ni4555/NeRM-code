```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges, and even worse if they connect two nodes with a high degree
    degree_matrix = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=0)
    degree_penalty = degree_matrix ** 2
    return distance_matrix + degree_penalty
```
