Task: Given an edge distance matrix and a current local optimal route for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), design and implement a dynamic heuristic strategy to update the edge distances. The strategy should be informed by the provided Python function, which takes into account the usage of each edge and adjusts distances to avoid local minima. The performance of this heuristic should be evaluated based on a fitness value of 3.55741. The goal is to iteratively refine the route, progressively moving towards a global optimal tour with the minimized total distance.
