1. Integrate usage data for edge weights, balance adjustments, add randomness.
2. Use non-linear transformations, refine penalties, measure density, introduce perturbations.
3. Minimize loops, balance short/long edges, use variability, maintain consistency.
4. Normalize data, consider multiple factors, introduce noise, ensure feasibility.
5. Use controlled perturbations, non-linear scaling, maintain bounds, avoid over-amplification.
6. Balance exploitation & exploration, adapt dynamically, incorporate edge properties.
7. Ensure non-negativity, incorporate usage frequency, add noise, balance length vs. frequency.
8. Focus on nuanced edge selection, control variance, incorporate feedback mechanisms.
9. Consider edge interaction, maintain symmetry, normalize for invariance, prevent premature convergence.
