- Select domain-appropriate metrics, normalize thoughtfully, and blend smoothness for balance.
- Employ non-linear transformations for precision, adjust heuristics with scale and context.
- Introduce penalties and perturbations to diversify search and penalize outliers.
- Refine heuristics with local insights, balance exploration with exploitation, and validate heuristics.
