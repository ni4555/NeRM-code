Fitness: 10.617516362484723

Description:
Optimizing the TSP through a novel hybrid evolutionary algorithm that synergizes a guided local search mechanism with intelligent parameter adjustment and an evolving neighborhood structure. This approach utilizes a precision heuristic matrix for rapid distance estimations, aiming to surpass a fitness threshold of 10.617516362484723 by harnessing a combination of heuristic-based initialization, dynamic mutation strategies, and adaptive selection criteria, fostering an algorithmic landscape conducive to discovering optimal routes.

    # Assuming that a higher heuristic value indicates a worse edge to include
    # and a distance of 0 should have a heuristic of 0 (no cost to include this edge)
    # This is a simple example heuristic where we just return the distance matrix
    # itself as the heuristic matrix. In a real-world scenario, you would implement
    # a more sophisticated heuristic based on the specific problem characteristics.
