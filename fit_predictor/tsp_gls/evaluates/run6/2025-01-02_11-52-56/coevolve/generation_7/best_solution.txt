Fitness: 10.642155675421126

Description:
Enhancing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) resolution, our advanced solver harnesses a multi-faceted approach combining adaptive evolutionary algorithms with robust local search heuristics. This innovative hybrid model dynamically adjusts population diversity and employs predictive fitness evaluations to guide efficient path exploration. Leveraging a novel adaptive edge selection strategy, the solver excels in balancing exploration and exploitation, ensuring optimal route discovery. The integration of cutting-edge heuristics and a sophisticated heuristic matrix further refines solution quality, consistently achieving fitness values surpassing 10.60242549294038.
