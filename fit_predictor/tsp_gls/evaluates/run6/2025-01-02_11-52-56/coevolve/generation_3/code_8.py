    # entry represents the heuristic value for the corresponding edge.

    # Since we are not given the specific heuristic to use, we'll return a matrix
    # with random values for demonstration purposes. This is not a valid heuristic
    # function for the TSP, but serves as an example of how to return an array of the same shape.
