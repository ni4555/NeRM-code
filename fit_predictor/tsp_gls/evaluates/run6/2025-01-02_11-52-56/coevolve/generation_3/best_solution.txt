Description:
Enhancing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution through a hybrid approach that incorporates a dynamic evolutionary algorithm with adaptive population swapping and predictive fitness projections, alongside guided local search techniques to iteratively refine and diversify the search space for optimal path efficiency and improved solutions beyond 10.61187021517528.
