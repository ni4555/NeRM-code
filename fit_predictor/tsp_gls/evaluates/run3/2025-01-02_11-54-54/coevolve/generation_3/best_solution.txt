Description:
Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a cutting-edge evolutionary algorithm that seamlessly integrates advanced guided local search mechanisms with adaptive tabu search strategies to achieve a balanced exploration and exploitation. This algorithm incorporates dynamic path optimization through intelligent parameter adaptation, leveraging a sophisticated distance matrix for heuristic computation. The hybrid approach aims to surpass existing fitness thresholds by synergizing the speed and efficiency of heuristic-driven guided local search with real-time, intelligent parameter adjustments, resulting in significantly enhanced TSP solutions with fitness values exceeding 10.617516362484723.
