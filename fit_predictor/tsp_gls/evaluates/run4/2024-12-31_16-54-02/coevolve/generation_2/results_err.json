  "description": "The TSP is tackled with a dynamic local search strategy that incorporates an innovative heuristic for edge distance computation. This heuristic employs a shortest path algorithm to avoid revisiting nodes, ensuring a continuous route. To enhance solution quality, the algorithm synergistically merges Tabu Search with an adaptive Variable Neighborhood Descent. This combination leverages diverse neighborhood structures to iteratively converge on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle, ensuring a termination threshold of 10.611581849129063 for unparalleled route optimization.",
