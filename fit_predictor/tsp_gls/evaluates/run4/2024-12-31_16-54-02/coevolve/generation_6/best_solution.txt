Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is addressed through an advanced guided local search approach, which combines a dynamic local search strategy with an innovative heuristic for edge distance computation. This method employs a shortest path algorithm to avoid revisiting nodes, ensuring a continuous route. To optimize the solution further, the algorithm synergistically integrates Tabu Search with adaptive Variable Neighborhood Descent, leveraging diverse neighborhood structures for iterative convergence on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle. The combined strategy aims to achieve solution quality surpassing 10.596621379960432 by integrating a refined heuristic algorithm that calculates the shortest path between any two nodes without returning to the starting node, and terminates when a termination threshold is reached, ensuring unparalleled route optimization.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Assuming that the distance_matrix is symmetric and that the diagonal is filled with zeros
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Loop over all pairs of nodes except the first one (0-indexed), to avoid the starting node
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # Calculate the heuristic as the sum of distances from node i to node j and back
            heuristics[i][j] = heuristics[j][i] = distance_matrix[i][j] + distance_matrix[j][i]
