```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Heuristic based on the average edge weight in the distance matrix
    avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix)
    # It's bad to include edges with weight significantly above the average
    return np.where(distance_matrix > avg_distance + (avg_distance * 0.1), 1, 0)
```
