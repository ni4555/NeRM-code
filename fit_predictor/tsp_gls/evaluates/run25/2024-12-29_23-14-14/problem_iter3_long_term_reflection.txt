1. Contextualize changes, penalize current route edges, use nuanced "badness" metrics.
2. Encourage diversification, adapt heuristics to problem structure.
3. Normalize measures, scale relative distances, explore beyond local optima.
4. Balance exploration and exploitation, consider neighbor interactions & global constraints.
