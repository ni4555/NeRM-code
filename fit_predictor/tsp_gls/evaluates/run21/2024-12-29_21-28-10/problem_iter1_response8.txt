```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the average distance between each node and all other nodes
    node_distances = np.mean(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # The heuristic value for each edge is the difference between the edge distance and the average distance
    # A higher heuristic value indicates that the edge is longer than the average distance and should be avoided
    return distance_matrix - node_distances[:, np.newaxis]
