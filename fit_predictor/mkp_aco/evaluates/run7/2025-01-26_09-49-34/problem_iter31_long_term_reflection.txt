1. Prioritize domain-specific insights, normalize for fairness, and iterate for refinement.
2. Integrate diversity and sparsity, balance exploration & exploitation, and adapt dynamically.
3. Normalize factors, use adaptive thresholds, and introduce sparsity thoughtfully.
4. Leverage meaningful features, balance factors, and refine iteratively with domain criteria.
5. Focus on variance control, normalize appropriately, and refine heuristics for enhanced performance.
