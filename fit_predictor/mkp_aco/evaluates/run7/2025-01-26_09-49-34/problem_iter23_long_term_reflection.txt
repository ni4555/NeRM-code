1. Balance diversity and sparsity with dynamic non-linear transformations.
2. Prioritize factors correlating with utility; normalize metrics to max for scale.
3. Adjust thresholds adaptively to balance exploration and exploitation.
4. Leverage domain knowledge for effective heuristic design; tune parameters for balance.
