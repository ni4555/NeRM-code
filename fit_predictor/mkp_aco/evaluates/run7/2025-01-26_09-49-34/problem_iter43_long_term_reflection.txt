1. Blend exploration with exploitation; adapt dynamically to maintain diversity.
2. Normalize and scale inputs to mitigate dominance; balance with variance and sparsity.
3. Emphasize non-dominated items; refine with dynamic thresholds and amplification.
4. Introduce controlled noise and floors for diversity; refine iteratively for balance.
