1. Focus on key factors, normalize, and balance exploration-exploitation.
2. Integrate domain knowledge, normalize, and refine dynamically.
3. Promote diversity, sparsity, and variance control in heuristics.
4. Use adaptive thresholds, sparsity, and normalization for robustness.
5. Combine domain-specific factors, normalize, and refine iteratively.
