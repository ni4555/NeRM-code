  "description": "Employing advanced metaheuristics and stochastic optimization techniques, we propose a novel solution framework for the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP) that leverages adaptive sampling strategies to iteratively refine candidate solutions. This approach integrates dynamic fitness evaluation, multi-objective optimization, and robust perturbation algorithms to achieve a synergistic balance between exploration and exploitation, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient prize maximization under stringent weight constraints.",
