  "description": "The objective is to develop a specialized stochastic heuristic for the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP) that maximizes total prize collection while adhering to strict multi-dimensional weight constraints. This heuristic employs adaptive sampling techniques to iteratively generate candidate solutions, incorporating dynamic fitness evaluation and robust perturbation algorithms to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. The approach aims to iteratively refine solutions using multi-objective optimization, enabling a synergistic effect that enhances both effectiveness and efficiency in solving the MKP under stringent constraints.",
