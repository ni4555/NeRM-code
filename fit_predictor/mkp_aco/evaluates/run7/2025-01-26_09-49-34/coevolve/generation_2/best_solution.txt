Fitness: inf

Description:
Integrate a probabilistic selection mechanism with a metaheuristic framework to tackle the Multi-Knapsack Problem, optimizing for maximum prize while respecting weight capacities. This approach should leverage dimensionality reduction for normalized item data, implement an adaptive sampling routine for iterative improvement, and utilize a dynamic fitness assessment for real-time optimization. By combining a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with local search techniques, this strategy aims to achieve a balanced exploration-exploration trade-off, ensuring efficient prize maximization under stringent weight constraints.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    # Normalize weight data
    weight_normalized = weight / np.sum(weight, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    # Calculate initial heuristic values based on normalized weights
    heuristic = np.dot(weight_normalized, prize)
    # Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=1)
    weight_reduced = pca.fit_transform(weight)
    # Update heuristic with reduced dimensionality
    heuristic += np.dot(weight_reduced, prize)
    # Adaptive sampling routine for iterative improvement
    for _ in range(10):  # Example of 10 iterations
        # Dynamic fitness assessment
        fitness = np.dot(weight_normalized, prize)
        # Update heuristic based on fitness
        heuristic = (heuristic * (1 - 0.1)) + (fitness * 0.1)
    # Local search to refine the heuristic
    for i in range(n):
        # Swap items to find a better heuristic
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap and calculate new heuristic
            new_heuristic = heuristic.copy()
            new_heuristic[i], new_heuristic[j] = new_heuristic[j], new_heuristic[i]
            # Update heuristic if better
            if np.sum(new_heuristic * weight) <= np.sum(heuristic * weight) and np.sum(new_heuristic * prize) > np.sum(heuristic * prize):
                heuristic = new_heuristic
    # Convert heuristic to binary selection
    heuristic_binary = (heuristic > np.mean(heuristic)).astype(int)
    return heuristic_binary
