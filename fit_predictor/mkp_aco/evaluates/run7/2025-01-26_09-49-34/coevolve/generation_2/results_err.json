  "description": "Integrate a probabilistic selection mechanism with a metaheuristic framework to tackle the Multi-Knapsack Problem, optimizing for maximum prize while respecting weight capacities. This approach should leverage dimensionality reduction for normalized item data, implement an adaptive sampling routine for iterative improvement, and utilize a dynamic fitness assessment for real-time optimization. By combining a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with local search techniques, this strategy aims to achieve a balanced exploration-exploration trade-off, ensuring efficient prize maximization under stringent weight constraints.",
