description: 'The problem at hand is to develop an optimization heuristic designed
  to solve the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP). The heuristic will leverage a combination
  of advanced metaheuristics and stochastic optimization techniques, ensuring a balanced
  exploration and exploitation of solution space. The key objectives are:


  1. To select a subset of items that maximizes the total prize collected while respecting
  the multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints of each knapsack.

  2. To dynamically refine candidate solutions using adaptive sampling strategies.

  3. To evaluate the fitness of solutions iteratively, with a focus on multi-objective
  optimization.

  4. To employ robust perturbation algorithms that maintain a fine-grained control
  over the solution space.

  5. To achieve an efficient and effective prize maximization within stringent weight
  constraints, avoiding local optima and promoting the convergence towards near-optimal
  or optimal solutions.


  This new approach must embody clarity and specificity by detailing the use of dynamic
  fitness evaluation and the integration of advanced algorithms to facilitate an efficient
  exploration of the problem domain. The strategy must avoid pitfalls such as over-reliance
  on random sampling, inefficient exploration of the solution space, and premature
  convergence to suboptimal solutions.'
