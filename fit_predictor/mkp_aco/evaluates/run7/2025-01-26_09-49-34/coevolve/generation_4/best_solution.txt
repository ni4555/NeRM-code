Fitness: inf

Description:
The problem at hand is to develop an optimization heuristic designed to solve the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP). The heuristic will leverage a combination of advanced metaheuristics and stochastic optimization techniques, ensuring a balanced exploration and exploitation of solution space. The key objectives are:

1. To select a subset of items that maximizes the total prize collected while respecting the multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints of each knapsack.
2. To dynamically refine candidate solutions using adaptive sampling strategies.
3. To evaluate the fitness of solutions iteratively, with a focus on multi-objective optimization.
4. To employ robust perturbation algorithms that maintain a fine-grained control over the solution space.
5. To achieve an efficient and effective prize maximization within stringent weight constraints, avoiding local optima and promoting the convergence towards near-optimal or optimal solutions.

This new approach must embody clarity and specificity by detailing the use of dynamic fitness evaluation and the integration of advanced algorithms to facilitate an efficient exploration of the problem domain. The strategy must avoid pitfalls such as over-reliance on random sampling, inefficient exploration of the solution space, and premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.
