1. Specify algorithmic details.
2. Use precise performance metrics.
3. Clarify optimization objectives.
Focus on the specific optimization, clear heuristics, and relevant algorithm details.
1. Focus on specific algorithms, e.g., "stochastic solution sampling," "heuristic," "normalized prize."
2. Avoid vague terms, e.g., "advanced," "synergistic balance."
3. Define clear objectives, e.g., "maximize total prize," "multi-dimensional constraints."
