description: Enhance the MKP resolution with an advanced stochastic iterative heuristic
  that leverages adaptive sampling, real-time fitness recalibration, and resilient
  perturbation strategies. The core strategy is to maximize the cumulative value of
  selected items within complex weight constraints, ensuring an optimal trade-off
  between exploration and exploitation. This innovative approach integrates a sophisticated
  multi-objective optimization framework to synergistically refine candidate solutions
  and broaden the search space, ultimately yielding robust solutions under stringent
  weight limitations.
