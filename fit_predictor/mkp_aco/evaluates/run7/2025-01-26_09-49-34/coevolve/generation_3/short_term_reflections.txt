Key elements: clarity, specific heuristic, direct performance metric

Misled aspects: jargon, vague optimization, lack of detail

Algorithm insights: better heuristic, direct objective, clear implementation

Hints for better descriptions: be specific, use actionable terms, focus on performance metrics
1. Key elements: "stochastic solution sampling," "heuristics," "multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints."
2. Misleading aspects: "advanced metaheuristics," "adaptive sampling strategies," "dynamic fitness evaluation," "robust perturbation algorithms."
3. Algorithmic insights: "normalized prize," "weight sum for each knapsack."

Hints:
- Use precise terms & avoid buzzwords.
- Describe the core algorithm clearly.
- Specify problem dimensions and constraints.
