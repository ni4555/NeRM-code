  "description": "Developing a heuristic-based stochastic solution sampler for the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP) with a focus on fairness through normalization, direct heuristic calculation, and efficiency under strict multi-dimensional weight constraints. This approach employs a simplified version of adaptive sampling, which iteratively refines candidate solutions through a combination of static and dynamic fitness evaluations, and incorporates robust perturbation techniques to balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in an optimized prize collection strategy without the complexity of full-fledged metaheuristics.",
