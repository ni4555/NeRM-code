1. Specific heuristic, clear objectives
2. Vague concepts, lack of detail
3. Algorithmic insights, optimization focus
1. Specific "heuristics" implementation, 2. Vague "adaptive sampling" & "robust perturbation," 3. Missing algorithm details.
1. Clarity, focus on heuristics, and problem specifics.
2. Overstatement, lack of heuristic details, and metaheuristic generalities.
3. Algorithmic insight, normalization, and direct weight consideration. 

Hint: Specify algorithm, heuristics, and key optimizations.
