1. Key elements: Item ranking, per-unit-weight prize value, explicit stochastic sampling.
2. Misleading/worse description: Ambiguous "value-to-weight ratio-driven," lacks stochastic element, no dynamic adaptation.
3. Algorithmic insights: Better description emphasizes ranking and unit value, leading to more effective sampling.

Hint: Be precise, emphasize stochastic ranking, and clarify optimization criteria.
in better descriptions, include:
- Key objectives
- Relevant metrics
- Algorithmic details
1. Key elements: explicit item ranking, per-unit-value normalization, stochastic sampling
2. Misleading aspects: vague "adaptive stochastic sampling," lack of item ranking detail
3. Algorithmic insights: better performance due to clear ranking and value normalization

Hints for better description:
- Specify ranking criteria (e.g., value-to-weight, per-unit-value)
- Define stochastic elements (e.g., random selection, probability adjustments)
- Avoid ambiguity in terms like "adaptive" and "stochastic"
1. Key elements: item ranking, unit-weight prize value, stochastic sampling
2. Misleading aspects: value-to-weight ratio normalization, dynamic weight constraint adaptation
3. Better insights: item importance, weighted importance, explicit ranking

Hints for better heuristic design:
- Clearly define the heuristic's goal (e.g., maximize unit-weight prize)
- Specify the method for item importance assessment
- Emphasize the stochastic aspect if needed for the algorithm's performance
