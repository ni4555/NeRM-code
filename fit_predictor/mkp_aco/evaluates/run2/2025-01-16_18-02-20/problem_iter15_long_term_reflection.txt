1. Emphasize key factors, sparsify complexity, and iteratively refine.
2. Integrate diverse metrics, normalize scores, and adapt thresholds dynamically.
3. Prioritize domain insights, balance simplicity with adaptability, and foster diversity in solutions.
4. Leverage multi-criteria analysis, normalize, and focus on core factors.
5. Adaptively refine trade-offs and thresholds based on real-time data distribution.
