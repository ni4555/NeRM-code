Description:
Develop an advanced algorithmic framework for addressing the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) through a comprehensive stochastic sampling strategy. This framework will integrate state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms with adaptive sampling mechanisms to dynamically select item subsets. The emphasis will be on leveraging a synergistic blend of evolutionary computation, specifically incorporating genetic algorithms, and heuristic-based stochastic local search techniques. The objective is to optimize the selection process, maximizing the cumulative value while respecting complex weight constraints, thus providing a robust and efficient solution approach for MKP.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    # Initialize heuristic scores as the inverse of the average weight for each item
    heuristics = 1 / np.mean(weight, axis=1)
    # Adjust heuristics based on prize to weight ratio
    heuristics = heuristics * (prize / heuristics)
    # Incorporate stochastic local search to refine heuristics
    for _ in range(10):  # Number of iterations for stochastic local search
        for i in range(n):
            # Randomly swap two items to evaluate the impact on heuristic
            j = np.random.randint(n)
            heuristics[i], heuristics[j] = heuristics[j], heuristics[i]
            # Evaluate the feasibility of the swap
            if np.all(weight * heuristics < 1):
                break
            # Swap back if the swap is not feasible
            heuristics[i], heuristics[j] = heuristics[j], heuristics[i]
    return heuristics
