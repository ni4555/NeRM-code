1. Clarity on problem (MKP), heuristic focus, and performance measure.
2. Avoid complex, non-specific terminology.
3. Highlight key methods (e.g., stochastic sampling, heuristic scoring).
4. Specify algorithmic details for implementation clarity.
1. Clarity on problem, heuristic approach, and specific goal.
2. Avoid abstract jargon, focus on practical techniques.
3. Specify algorithmic details, especially the heuristic method used.
1. Clarity on the problem: Specific to MKP, using "stochastic solution sampling" and "maximize total prize".
2. Concise algorithm mention: "heuristics" indicates direct optimization without heavy overhead.
3. Better description hints: Specify the heuristic used, performance metrics, and focus on problem specifics.
