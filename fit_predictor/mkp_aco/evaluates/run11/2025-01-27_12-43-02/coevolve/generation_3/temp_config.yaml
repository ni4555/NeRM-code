description: Develop an advanced algorithmic framework for addressing the Multiple
  Knapsack Problem (MKP) through a comprehensive stochastic sampling strategy. This
  framework will integrate state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms with
  adaptive sampling mechanisms to dynamically select item subsets. The emphasis will
  be on leveraging a synergistic blend of evolutionary computation, specifically incorporating
  genetic algorithms, and heuristic-based stochastic local search techniques. The
  objective is to optimize the selection process, maximizing the cumulative value
  while respecting complex weight constraints, thus providing a robust and efficient
  solution approach for MKP.
