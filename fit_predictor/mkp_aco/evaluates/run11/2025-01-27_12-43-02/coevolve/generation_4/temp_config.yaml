description: Integrating a dynamic heuristic for the Multi-Knapsack Problem, this
  solution harnesses a probabilistic reinforcement learning framework alongside an
  adaptive sampling mechanism. It implements a synergistic fusion of evolutionary
  genetic algorithms and stochastic optimization algorithms to iteratively refine
  the selection of optimal item clusters, optimizing both item diversity and weight
  distribution constraints.
