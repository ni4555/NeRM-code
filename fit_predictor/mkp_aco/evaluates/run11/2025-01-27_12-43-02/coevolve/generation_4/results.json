  "description": "Integrating a dynamic heuristic for the Multi-Knapsack Problem, this solution harnesses a probabilistic reinforcement learning framework alongside an adaptive sampling mechanism. It implements a synergistic fusion of evolutionary genetic algorithms and stochastic optimization algorithms to iteratively refine the selection of optimal item clusters, optimizing both item diversity and weight distribution constraints.",
