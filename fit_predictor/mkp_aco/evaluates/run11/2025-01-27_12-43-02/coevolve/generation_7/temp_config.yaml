description: The proposed solution leverages a multifaceted algorithmic approach to
  tackle the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP), employing a combination of heuristic-based
  random sampling, adaptive sampling strategies, iterative reinforcement learning,
  and a synergistic ensemble of genetic algorithms with stochastic local search algorithms.
  This hybrid framework is designed to iteratively optimize the selection of item
  subsets across multiple knapsacks, ensuring a balance between maximizing total item
  value and respecting individual knapsack weight limitations. The core optimization
  strategies include genetic algorithm adaptation, stochastic exploration for diversification,
  reinforcement learning for policy improvement, and the integration of local search
  techniques to refine candidate solutions. This innovative combination aims to enhance
  solution quality, maintain computational efficiency, and ensure the effectiveness
  of the MKP resolution within the designated time constraints. Performance is evaluated
  through a composite metric of selected items' value and adherence to knapsack weight
  restrictions.
