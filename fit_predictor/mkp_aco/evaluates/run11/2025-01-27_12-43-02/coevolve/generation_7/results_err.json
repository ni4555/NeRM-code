  "description": "The proposed solution leverages a multifaceted algorithmic approach to tackle the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP), employing a combination of heuristic-based random sampling, adaptive sampling strategies, iterative reinforcement learning, and a synergistic ensemble of genetic algorithms with stochastic local search algorithms. This hybrid framework is designed to iteratively optimize the selection of item subsets across multiple knapsacks, ensuring a balance between maximizing total item value and respecting individual knapsack weight limitations. The core optimization strategies include genetic algorithm adaptation, stochastic exploration for diversification, reinforcement learning for policy improvement, and the integration of local search techniques to refine candidate solutions. This innovative combination aims to enhance solution quality, maintain computational efficiency, and ensure the effectiveness of the MKP resolution within the designated time constraints. Performance is evaluated through a composite metric of selected items' value and adherence to knapsack weight restrictions.",
