Description:
Optimizing the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) using a stochastic solution sampling approach with a focus on heuristics. The objective is to identify an efficient subset of items that maximizes the total prize while adhering to weight limits across multiple knapsacks. This involves employing a clear definition of the problem, leveraging practical heuristic methods for sampling, and using concise algorithms to address the core aspects of the MKP.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create a heuristic array initialized to 0
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(prize)
    
    # Normalize weights for each item to create a relative weight value
    relative_weight = weight / np.sum(weight, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    
    # Calculate heuristic values as the ratio of prize to normalized weight
    heuristics = prize / relative_weight
    
    # Apply a simple speed optimization: clip extreme values
    heuristics = np.clip(heuristics, 0.1, 9.9)
    
    return heuristics
