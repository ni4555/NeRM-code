  "description": "Optimizing the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) using a stochastic solution sampling approach with a focus on heuristics. The objective is to identify an efficient subset of items that maximizes the total prize while adhering to weight limits across multiple knapsacks. This involves employing a clear definition of the problem, leveraging practical heuristic methods for sampling, and using concise algorithms to address the core aspects of the MKP.",
