Description:
Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) through stochastic solution sampling based on "heuristics". MKP involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total prize collected, subject to multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    m = weight.shape[1]
    normalized_weights = np.linalg.norm(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)[:, None]
    score = np.sum(prize * normalized_weights, axis=1)
    return score
