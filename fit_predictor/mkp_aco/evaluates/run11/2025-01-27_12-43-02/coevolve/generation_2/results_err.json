  "description": "The goal is to develop a heuristic-based approach for solving the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), where the objective is to select a subset of items from multiple knapsacks to maximize the total prize while adhering to each knapsack's individual weight constraints. The solution strategy should employ stochastic sampling to explore the solution space efficiently, leveraging established heuristics for item subset selection. The emphasis is on creating a clear and direct optimization process that focuses on the core problem and effective strategies, without the complexity of ensemble methods or over-simplification through stochastic sampling alone.",
