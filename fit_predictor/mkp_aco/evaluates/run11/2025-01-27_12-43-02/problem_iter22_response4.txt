```python
import numpy as np

    n = weight.shape[0]
    # Calculate the ratio of prize to weight for each item
    prize_to_weight_ratio = prize / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)
    # Normalize the ratios to get the heuristics
    heuristics = prize_to_weight_ratio / np.sum(prize_to_weight_ratio)
