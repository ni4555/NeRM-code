1. Focus core metrics, balance importance & diversity, minimize complexity.
2. Normalize consistently, use dynamic thresholds, and explore randomness.
3. Integrate diversity, normalize, balance, and adapt dynamically.
4. Simplify, balance, and prioritize simplicity over redundancy.
5. Leverage insights, refine thresholds, and adapt to problem specifics.
