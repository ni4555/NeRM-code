```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    # Calculate normalized prize value
    score = np.sum(prize, axis=1)
    # Calculate normalized weight and account for 0 weight items
    ratio = score / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)
    # Calculate threshold as the 90th percentile of the normalized scores
    threshold = np.percentile(ratio, 90)
    # Apply threshold to get the heuristics
    heuristics = (ratio >= threshold)
    return heuristics.astype(int)
