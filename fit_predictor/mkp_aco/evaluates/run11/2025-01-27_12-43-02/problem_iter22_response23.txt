```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the ratio of prize to the sum of weights, avoiding division by zero
    ratio = prize / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)
    # Calculate a single heuristic score as the ratio itself
    heuristics = ratio
    return heuristics
