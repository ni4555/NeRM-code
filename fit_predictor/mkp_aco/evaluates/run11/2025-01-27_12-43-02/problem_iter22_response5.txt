```python

    m = weight.shape[1]
    normalized_weights = np.linalg.norm(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)[:, None]
    value_weight_ratio = prize / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)  # Avoid division by zero
    importance = np.sum(value_weight_ratio * normalized_weights, axis=1)
    importance_normalized = importance / np.sum(importance)
