1. Prioritize core metrics, balance diversity, and dynamically refine thresholds.
2. Normalize scores, simplify complexity, and explore randomness for diversity.
3. Integrate importance, diversity, and use percentile thresholds for control.
4. Combine value measures, balance simplicity, and minimize redundancy.
5. Dynamically adjust weights, focus on core factors, and refine with domain specifics.
