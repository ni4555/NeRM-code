```python

    n, m = weight.shape
    normalized_weights = np.linalg.norm(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)[:, None]
    score = np.sum(prize * normalized_weights, axis=1)
    ratio = prize / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)  # Avoid division by zero
    importance_normalized = score * ratio / np.sum(score * ratio)
    return importance_normalized
