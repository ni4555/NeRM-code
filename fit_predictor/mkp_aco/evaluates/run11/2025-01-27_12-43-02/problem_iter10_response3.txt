```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    score = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)[:, None]
    threshold = np.max(score) / 2  # Dynamic threshold as a fraction of the maximum score
    heuristics = (score > threshold).astype(float)
    return heuristics
