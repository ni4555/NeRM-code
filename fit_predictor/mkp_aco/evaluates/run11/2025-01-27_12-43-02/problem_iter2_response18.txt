    normalized_weights = np.sum(weight, axis=1)[:, None]
    # Calculate score for each item
    score = np.sum(prize * weight, axis=1)
    # Calculate importance by considering both prize and normalized weight
    importance = score / (normalized_weights + 1e-8)  # Avoid division by zero
    # Use a combination of score and importance to determine heuristics
