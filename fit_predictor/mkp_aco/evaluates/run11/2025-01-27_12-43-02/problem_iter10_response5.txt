```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the ratio of prize to the average weight of each item
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Normalize the ratio to ensure diversity
    normalized_ratio = ratio / np.sum(ratio)
    # Return the normalized ratio as heuristics
    return normalized_ratio
