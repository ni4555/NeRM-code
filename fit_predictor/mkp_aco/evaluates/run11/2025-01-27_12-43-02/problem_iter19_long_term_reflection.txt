- Diversify metrics, normalize scores, balance sparsity and exploration, and refine thresholds dynamically.
- Prioritize simplicity, single metrics, and avoid redundancy; normalize once, balance exploration-exploitation, and evaluate dynamically.
- Integrate domain insights, simplify normalization, use percentile thresholds, and refine sparsity and importance for clarity.
