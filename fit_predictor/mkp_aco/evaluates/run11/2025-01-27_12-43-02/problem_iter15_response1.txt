def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    m = weight.shape[1]
    # Calculate the weight of each item as a function of the ratio of prize to total weight
    ratio = prize / (np.sum(weight, axis=1) + 1e-8)  # Avoid division by zero
    # Calculate the sparsity as the inverse of the weight, encouraging selection of lighter items
    sparsity = 1 / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Normalize the combined sparsity and ratio
    normalized_weights = (ratio * sparsity) / (ratio * sparsity).sum()
