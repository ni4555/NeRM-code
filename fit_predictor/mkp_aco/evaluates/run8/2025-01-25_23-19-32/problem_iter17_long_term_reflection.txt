1. Prioritize diverse item selections, adjusting thresholds adaptively.
2. Integrate domain insights for balanced variance and sparsity.
3. Normalize data and dynamically adjust importance measures.
4. Emphasize item variance for exploration, while maintaining sparsity.
5. Balance exploration with exploitation by incorporating randomness and local optimization.
