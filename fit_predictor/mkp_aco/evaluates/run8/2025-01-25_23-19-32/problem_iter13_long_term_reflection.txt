1. Normalize data, emphasize item importance, and promote diversity & sparsity.
2. Balance factors, use domain-specific insights, and adapt thresholds dynamically.
3. Integrate randomness, enforce constraints, and normalize heuristics for consistency.
4. Optimize by balancing diversity, importance, and sparsity, with threshold-based selection.
