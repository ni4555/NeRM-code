```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the normalized prize to weight ratio for each item
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Introduce a sparsity factor based on the maximum ratio
    sparsity_factor = np.max(ratio)
    # Calculate importance considering the ratio and sparsity
    importance = ratio / sparsity_factor
    # Normalize the importance to sum to 1
    importance /= np.sum(importance)
    return importance
