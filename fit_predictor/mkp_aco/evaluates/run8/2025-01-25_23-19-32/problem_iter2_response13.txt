```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the normalized prize to weight ratio
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Incorporate quadratic factors to balance ratio and sparsity
    quadratic_factor = 1 - np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    # Create the heuristics array
    heuristics = ratio * quadratic_factor
    return heuristics
