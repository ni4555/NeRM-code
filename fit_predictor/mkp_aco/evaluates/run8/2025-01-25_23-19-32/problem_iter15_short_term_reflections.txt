Integrate diversity, dynamic thresholds, and adapt balance based on overall context.
Avoid redundant normalization, balance factors appropriately, and use adaptive diversity to improve heuristic performance.
- Weight multiple factors: Combine importance, diversity, and sparsity.
- Use dynamic thresholds: Adapt to problem complexity.
- Normalize outputs: Ensure sum-to-1 for consistent interpretation.
- Encourage variety: Focus on diverse solutions, not just high importance.
