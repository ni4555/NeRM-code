```python

    # Calculate the normalized prize to weight ratio
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Calculate the quadratic term for each item
    quadratic_term = (prize**2) / (np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2)
    # Calculate the heuristics using both the ratio and the quadratic term
    heuristics = ratio * (1 - quadratic_term)
