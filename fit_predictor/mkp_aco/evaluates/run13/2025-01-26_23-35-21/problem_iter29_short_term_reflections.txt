Incorporate multi-dimensional metrics, balance diversity and value, and normalize appropriately.
1. Initialize diversity with random item selection.
2. Use weighted metrics and normalize heuristics.
3. Combine simple heuristic calculations effectively.
4. Incorporate diversity early and update heuristics iteratively.

- Adjust threshold to maintain sparsity without over-filtering.
- Focus on diversity, avoid dominance.
- Balance positive factors, not just sum.
- Normalize carefully, maintain range.
- Avoid penalties without clear benefit.
