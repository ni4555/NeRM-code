1. Emphasize single, clear value metrics, average thresholds, and correlated factors.
2. Balance diversity, normalize, and avoid simplistic thresholds.
3. Prioritize quality metrics, normalize comparisons, and use domain-specific insights.
4. Combine meaningful metrics, weight appropriately, and consider sparsity.
5. Normalize values, use relative measures, and personalize thresholds.
6. Opt for simplicity, stability, and sparsity, focusing on core factors and problem-specific features.
