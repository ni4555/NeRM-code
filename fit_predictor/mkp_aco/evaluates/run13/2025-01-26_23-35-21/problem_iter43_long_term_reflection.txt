1. Balance metrics, normalize, and integrate randomness for diverse solutions.
2. Prioritize utility, encourage diversity, and balance exploration vs. exploitation.
3. Simplify, core metrics first, normalize, and adjust for dominance and sparsity.
4. Prune low-quality, focus on balance, and introduce diversity through randomness.
