```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate utility based on prize per unit weight
    utility = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Sparsify by applying a threshold based on the overall average utility
    threshold = np.mean(utility)
    # Set elements below the threshold to zero, to encourage selecting higher utility items
    heuristics = np.where(utility >= threshold, utility, 0)
    return heuristics
