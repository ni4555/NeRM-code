Use normalized metrics, balance metrics, prune dominated solutions, and introduce randomness for diversity.
Optimize metric selection, balance diversity & balance, and introduce randomness.
Consider diversity, balance, and adaptability in heuristic design.
- Use meaningful metrics, prune dominated items, balance diversity, and normalize scores.
Balance density & sparsity, prune dominated solutions, randomize wisely, normalize thoughtfully.
