    max_prize = np.max(prize)
    normalized_prize = prize / max_prize
    average_weight = np.mean(weight, axis=1)
    sparsity_threshold = average_weight * 0.1  # 10% of the average weight for sparsity
    # Heuristics are the product of normalized prize and a mask that is 1 when the weight is less than the sparsity threshold
    heuristics = normalized_prize * (average_weight < sparsity_threshold)
