```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the density of each item (prize/weight)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Normalize by the maximum density
    normalized_density = density / (np.max(density) + 1e-8)
    
    # Return the normalized density as heuristics
    return normalized_density
