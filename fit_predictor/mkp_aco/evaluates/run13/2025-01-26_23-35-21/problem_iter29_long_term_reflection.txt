1. Balance value & diversity with normalized metrics, penalize outliers, & avoid dominance.
2. Simplify & combine metrics, optimize normalization, and integrate randomness for diversity.
3. Prioritize key item properties, balance metrics, & use normalization to maintain bounds.
4. Focus on diversity, blend metrics, & incorporate penalties for sparsity and outliers.
5. Normalize metrics uniformly, balance objectives, and minimize parameter sensitivity.
6. Leverage randomness, manage edge cases, & normalize diversity for effective sampling.
