1. Focus on a single, clear measure of item value.
2. Use a threshold based on overall average to identify promising items.
3. Avoid combining multiple measures unless they are highly correlated.
Incorporate diversity (variance) to avoid overfitting to common item features.
Consider problem characteristics, weight item-specific attributes, and balance diversity and concentration.

Incorporate diverse criteria, weight each criterion appropriately, and avoid overly simplistic thresholding.
Consider individual item properties, adjust weights based on context, and use domain-specific thresholds.
Incorporate multiple criteria, consider item sparsity, and balance between criteria weights.
Focus on item-specific metrics, leverage item sparsity, and balance metrics with weighted aggregation.
Consider diversity and density, normalize, avoid simplistic averaging, and tune thresholds.
Incorporate multiple metrics, use weighted combination, and avoid sparsity by smoothing.
Utilize meaningful ratios, consider constraints, and assign proper weights.
Use multiple item characteristics, normalize, and apply thresholds.
