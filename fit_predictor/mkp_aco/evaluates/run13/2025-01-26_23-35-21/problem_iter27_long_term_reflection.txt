1. Prioritize item-specific metrics, normalize diversity, and fine-tune penalties.
2. Minimize complexity, use unique features, and blend metrics with caution.
3. Optimize for diversity and relevance, avoid redundancy, and normalize effectively.
4. Design metrics for clarity, incorporate randomness, and balance penalties.
5. Focus on item properties, use normalization, and manage edge cases.
6. Balance metrics, normalize diversity, and adapt penalties dynamically.
