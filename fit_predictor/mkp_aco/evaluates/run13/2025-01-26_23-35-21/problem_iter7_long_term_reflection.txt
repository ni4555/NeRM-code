1. Prioritize essential metrics, balance utility, diversity, and normalize effectively.
2. Employ domain insights, normalize by maxima, and blend metrics for a balanced heuristic.
3. Focus on meaningful metrics, normalize, and use transformations for diversity and robustness.
4. Integrate multiple metrics, normalize, and manage sparsity, diversity, and thresholds.
