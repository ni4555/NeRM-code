```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = weight.shape

    # Normalize the prize to have a mean of 1
    normalized_prize = prize / prize.mean()

    # Calculate utility based on normalized prize and weight
    utility = normalized_prize / weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)

    # Calculate the maximum utility for each item
    max_utility = utility.max(axis=1)
