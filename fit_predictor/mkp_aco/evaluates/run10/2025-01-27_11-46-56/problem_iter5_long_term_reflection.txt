- Prioritize high-utility items, simplify heuristics, and balance utility and diversity.
- Minimize complexity by focusing on essential factors and incorporating diversity.
- Normalize utilities, use bounded heuristics, and validate assumptions to avoid dominance.
- Emphasize performance indicators, prune redundancies, and balance exploration vs. exploitation.
