```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = weight.shape
    normalized_weight = weight / weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    utility = prize / normalized_weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    # Use a simple heuristic based on utility and normalize it
    heuristic = (utility / utility.max()).astype(float)
    return heuristic
