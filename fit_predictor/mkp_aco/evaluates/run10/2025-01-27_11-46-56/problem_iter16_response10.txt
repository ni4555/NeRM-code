```python

    # Normalize the prize and weight along the items to ensure fairness in comparison
    normalized_prize = prize / prize.sum()
    normalized_weight = weight / weight.sum()
    
    # The heuristic is directly proportional to the normalized prize
    # which represents the maximum prize that can be achieved per unit of weight
