1. Craft simple, domain-specific heuristics; balance exploration & exploitation.
2. Prioritize global maxima; use robust factors; adapt with context and time.
3. Normalize values for diversity; adapt to utility and dynamics; streamline computations.
4. Focus on core value; simplify complexity; incorporate domain insights effectively.
5. Use adaptive, non-linear diversity; refine randomness and normalization; optimize utility.
