- Simplify while capturing core problem features, normalize values, balance exploitation and exploration.
- Promote diversity with noise, leverage domain knowledge, adapt heuristics dynamically.
- Normalize consistently, use relative values, avoid redundancy, and keep complexity low.
- Balance utility and diversity, consider constraints, use time-based adjustments for adaptability.
