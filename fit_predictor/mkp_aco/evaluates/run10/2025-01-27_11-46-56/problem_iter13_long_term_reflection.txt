1. Streamline utility factors, focusing on direct relevance and simplicity.
2. Normalize data for fair comparison without overcomplicating.
3. Leverage domain knowledge for heuristic design, balancing complexity and effectiveness.
4. Use diversity to avoid local optima, balance exploration and exploitation.
5. Opt for simplicity in calculations and avoid unnecessary complexity.
