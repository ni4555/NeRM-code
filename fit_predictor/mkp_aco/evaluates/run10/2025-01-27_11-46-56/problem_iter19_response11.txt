```python

    m = weight.shape[1]
    normalized_weight = weight / weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    utility = prize / (normalized_weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, prize.shape))
    max_utility = utility.max(axis=1)
    diversity_factor = np.random.uniform(0, 1, prize.shape)
    return (max_utility + diversity_factor) / (1 + diversity_factor)
