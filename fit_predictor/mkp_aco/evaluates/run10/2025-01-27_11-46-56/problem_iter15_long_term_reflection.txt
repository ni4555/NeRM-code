1. Prioritize core problem features; simplify heuristics.
2. Normalize for balance, maximize utility, avoid redundancy.
3. Leverage domain knowledge, balance exploitation & exploration.
4. Simplify complexity; use relative values for fair comparisons.
5. Normalize consistently, focus on individual item quality.
6. Introduce controlled randomness, avoid over-reliance on it.
7. Amplify diversity, refine normalization, scale appropriately.
8. Optimize exploration with variance, consider item-specific adjustments.
9. Utilize consistent scaling and normalize by key problem aspects.
