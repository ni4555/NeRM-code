description: Enhancing MKP resolution through a refined hybrid metaheuristic framework,
  we emphasize integrated adaptive weight allocation for dynamic knapsack partitioning,
  coupled with a strategically enhanced heuristic-based sampling mechanism, to precisely
  refine subset selection, ultimately maximizing reward gains while rigorously maintaining
  capacity constraints.
