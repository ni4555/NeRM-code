  "description": "The objective is to devise a sophisticated optimization algorithm for the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) that achieves maximum prize collection through a dynamic allocation of item subsets, constrained by multi-dimensional weight limits. The algorithm shall incorporate a self-adaptive weight distribution system to enhance partitioning efficiency, and apply a precision-based heuristic sampling method for targeted subset selection. The approach will focus on leveraging the evolving nature of the MKP to foster solution diversity, and implement normalization techniques to fine-tune the weight allocation process, ensuring a balanced and efficient optimization strategy.",
