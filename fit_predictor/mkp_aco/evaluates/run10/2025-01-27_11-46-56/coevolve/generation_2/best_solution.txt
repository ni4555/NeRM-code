Description:
Employing advanced hybrid metaheuristics for MKP resolution, we emphasize adaptive dynamic knapsack weight partitioning and intelligent heuristic-based sampling to optimize subset choice, thereby significantly improving reward acquisition and adherence to capacity constraints.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)
    total_capacity = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the total value of the remaining items in the prize array
        remaining_prize = np.delete(prize, i, axis=0)
        max_val = np.max(remaining_prize)
        # Calculate the heuristics for the current item
        heuristics[i] = prize[i] / max_val
    return heuristics
