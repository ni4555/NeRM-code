  "description": "The task is to devise an optimized heuristic algorithm for solving the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). The algorithm must dynamically adapt item weights in real-time to optimize multi-dimensional constraints, while ensuring the efficient partitioning of knapsacks. It should implement a sophisticated heuristic-based sampling technique to selectively sample item subsets for maximized prize collection. The algorithm must prioritize solution diversity to avoid local optima and integrate normalization techniques to enhance utility calculations, leading to an improved total prize collection while adhering to weight constraints.",
