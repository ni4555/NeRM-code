description: The task is to devise an optimized heuristic algorithm for solving the
  Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). The algorithm must dynamically adapt item weights
  in real-time to optimize multi-dimensional constraints, while ensuring the efficient
  partitioning of knapsacks. It should implement a sophisticated heuristic-based sampling
  technique to selectively sample item subsets for maximized prize collection. The
  algorithm must prioritize solution diversity to avoid local optima and integrate
  normalization techniques to enhance utility calculations, leading to an improved
  total prize collection while adhering to weight constraints.
