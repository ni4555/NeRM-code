Focus on specifics like algorithm dynamics, normalization, and solution diversity.
1. Emphasize dynamic adaptation, precise sampling, and optimization strategies.
2. Avoid vague terms and ensure clarity on objectives and constraints.
3. Specify algorithmic features like normalization and diversity promotion.
Key Elements: Dynamic adaptive, refined heuristic, diversity, normalization.
Misleading Aspects: Stochastic, no adaptive mechanisms, lack of diversity focus.
Optimization Insights: Incorporate adaptivity, heuristics, and normalization.

Hint: Emphasize adaptive strategies, heuristic refinement, and normalization techniques.
