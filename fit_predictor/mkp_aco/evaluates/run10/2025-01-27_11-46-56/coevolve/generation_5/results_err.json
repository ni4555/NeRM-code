  "description": "The objective is to develop a robust optimization algorithm for the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), which involves selecting item subsets to maximize total prize collection while adhering to strict multi-dimensional weight constraints. The algorithm should incorporate a dynamic adaptive weight allocation mechanism to efficiently partition knapsacks, and utilize a refined heuristic-based sampling strategy to ensure precise subset selection. This approach aims to enhance problem-solving efficiency by focusing on the dynamics of the MKP, promoting diversity in solutions, and applying normalization techniques to optimize the allocation process.",
