Description:
The objective is to develop a cutting-edge, adaptive optimization algorithm for the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) that achieves maximum prize accumulation within intricate weight constraints. This algorithm will implement a sophisticated normalization framework for dynamic, adaptive weight distribution across knapsacks, ensuring efficient load balancing. Furthermore, it will leverage a refined heuristic-driven subset sampling mechanism for precise item selection. The solution will be meticulously crafted to exploit the inherent complexities of the MKP, with a strong emphasis on adaptability and tailored performance metrics. The approach will involve precise techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms and local search heuristics, to enhance optimization success and provide a robust solution strategy.

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the total weight for each knapsack (since all weights are 1, this is the count of items)
    knapsack_capacity = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the total prize
    total_prize = np.sum(prize)
    
    # Calculate the normalized prize for each item
    normalized_prize = prize / total_prize
    
    # Calculate the heuristic as the product of the normalized prize and the capacity of the knapsack
    # This heuristic gives higher weight to items that provide more prize per unit of weight
    heuristic = normalized_prize * knapsack_capacity
    
    # Normalize the heuristic so that the sum of all heuristics equals the total prize
    heuristic /= np.sum(heuristic)
    
    return heuristic
