```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    m = weight.shape[1]
    normalized_weight = weight / weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    utility = prize / (normalized_weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) + 1e-8)  # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero
    return utility
```
