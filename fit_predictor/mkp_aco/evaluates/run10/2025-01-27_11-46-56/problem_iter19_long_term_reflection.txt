1. Keep heuristics simple and domain-focused.
2. Normalize values, avoid redundancy, and balance exploitation/exploration.
3. Emphasize diversity, noise, and utility; adapt dynamically.
4. Use non-linear factors, randomness, and time-sensitivity.
5. Prioritize simplicity, balance, and adaptability.
