1. Craft heuristics balancing domain-specific simplicity and robustness.
2. Focus on critical factors, normalize for consistency, and adapt with context.
3. Integrate non-linear diversity, utility, and time-sensitivity for adaptability.
4. Maximize utility, balance exploration & exploitation, and refine normalization.
5. Use peak functions, avoid redundancy, and optimize complexity for efficiency.
