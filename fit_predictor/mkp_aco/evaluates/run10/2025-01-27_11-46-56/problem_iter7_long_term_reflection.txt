1. Prioritize utility, simplify, and maintain diversity.
2. Normalize metrics, adapt thresholds, and balance objectives.
3. Integrate diversity into utility, normalize, and dynamically adjust.
4. Use multiple metrics, balance, and refine heuristics.
5. Normalize, avoid dominance, and bound heuristics.
