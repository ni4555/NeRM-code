1. **Prioritize Key Features**: Identify essential items, ignore redunant, to enhance utility.
2. **Simplify with Simplicity**: Embrace basic, strong heuristics for direct utility gains.
3. **Relate Metrics Relative**: Use relative utility for comparison, reducing absolute complexities.
4. **Maximize Without Pruning**: Retain all high-utility items, prune later.
5. **Validate Intuition**: Apply domain knowledge, but back with empirical validation.
6. **Avoid Redundancy**: Streamline calculations, eliminating superfluous computations.
7. **Focus on Performance**: Tailor heuristics to key indicators for optimal efficiency.
8. **Balance Trade-Offs**: Strive for a blend of utility and diversity for robust solutions.
