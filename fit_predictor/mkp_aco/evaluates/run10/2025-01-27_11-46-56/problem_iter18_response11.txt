```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the utility of each item
    utility = prize / weight.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    # Return the maximum utility for each item, representing its quality
    max_utility = utility.max(axis=1)
    return max_utility
