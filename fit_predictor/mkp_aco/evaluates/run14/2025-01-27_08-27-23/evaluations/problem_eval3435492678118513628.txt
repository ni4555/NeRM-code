importance for inclusion in the knapsack solution by using a ratio or proportion based on prize to weight comparisons.

New Algorithm Sentence: Use a geometric mean to assess item attractiveness while considering individual weight proportions across all dimensions.

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize, weight):
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        ratio = np.prod(prize[i] / weight[i])
        heuristics[i] = np.log(ratio)
    return heuristics_matrix
