importance of each item by normalizing the item's prize relative to the item's total weight or by combining prize and weight to form a weighted probability.

New Algorithm Sentence:
{Calculate heuristics by summing the ratio of the normalized prize to the maximum weight per item across dimensions, penalizing items with higher total weights more.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize, weight):
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    normalized_prize = prize / prize.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
    max_weights_per_item = weight.max(axis=1)
    heuristics = normalized_prize / (max_weights_per_item + 1e-6)
    return heuristics_matrix
