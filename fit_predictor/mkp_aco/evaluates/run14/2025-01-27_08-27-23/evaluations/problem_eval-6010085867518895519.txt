importance of each item.

New Algorithm Description:
```
Calculate item heuristics as the difference between the average prize-to-weight ratio for all items and the prize-to-weight ratio for each individual item.
```

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize, weight):
    n = prize.shape[0]
    total_average_ratio = np.sum(prize) / np.sum(weight)
    heuristics = total_average_ratio - (prize / weight).ravel()
    return heuristics_matrix
