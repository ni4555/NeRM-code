1. Prioritize high-value-to-weight items; blend exploration with exploitation.
2. Employ penalties for outliers; balance diversity with focus on key factors.
3. Normalize factors; use meaningful thresholds and simple sparsity rules.
4. Introduce randomness for diversity, while maintaining sparsity control.
5. Normalize early, combine later; avoid complexity; focus on domain-related factors.
6. Optimize for smooth transitions; minimize noise; refine sparsity criteria.
7. Use robust statistics; balance constraints with exploratory features.
8. Integrate domain knowledge; balance randomness with heuristic significance.
9. Simplify complexity; enhance computational efficiency; focus on relevant features.
10. Streamline normalization, avoid redundancy; promote diversity without overfitting.
