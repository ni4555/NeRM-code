  "description": "Design a hybrid optimization algorithm for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) that utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) for diversity and a Simulated Annealing (SA) for refined local search. The algorithm should employ a value-to-weight ratio-based heuristic to prioritize items, ensuring maximum total value while respecting multi-dimensional weight and volume constraints. The genetic algorithm will use a fitness function that considers both constraint compliance and total value, with selection based on normalized value-to-weight ratios. The GA will employ specific operators such as tournament selection, single-point crossover, and mutation for evolution. The Simulated Annealing component will refine the solutions by allowing occasional violations of constraints at higher temperatures, which will be reduced over generations to exploit promising regions. Termination will be based on a predefined number of generations, a convergence threshold, or when no improvement is observed over a set number of iterations. The algorithm will be evaluated on its ability to maximize the average solution value, minimize constraint violations, and optimize computational efficiency, with the goal of achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation.",
