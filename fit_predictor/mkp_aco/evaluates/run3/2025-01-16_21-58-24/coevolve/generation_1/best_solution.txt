Description:
Employing a hybrid stochastic optimization framework, we aim to solve the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) by integrating advanced heuristic-based sampling techniques with dynamic programming and metaheuristics. This approach leverages a combination of random sampling, evolutionary algorithms, and local search strategies to efficiently explore the solution space, ensuring both diversity and convergence towards optimal or near-optimal solutions while respecting the complex weight and capacity constraints of the MKP.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Assuming that each item has only one weight in each dimension (weight shape is (n, m) where m=1)
    # and the prize is a one-dimensional array (prize shape is (n,)).
    
    # Calculate the total weight for each item, which is the sum of weights across dimensions
    total_weight = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    # The heuristic could be a simple function of the prize-to-weight ratio
    # For example, a heuristic based on the value/weight ratio for each item
    # The function chosen here is to calculate the inverse of the ratio
    # This is a common heuristic approach to prioritize items with a higher value per unit of weight
    heuristics = 1 / (total_weight + 1e-6)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    return heuristics
