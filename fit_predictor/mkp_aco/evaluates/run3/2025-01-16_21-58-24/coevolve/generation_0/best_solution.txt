Description:
Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) through stochastic solution sampling based on "heuristics". MKP involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total prize collected, subject to multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # This is a placeholder for the actual heuristic algorithm. The following code
    # generates a random heuristic for each item based on the prize value.
    # A real heuristic would take into account the constraints and the goal of the problem.
    return np.random.rand(len(prize))
