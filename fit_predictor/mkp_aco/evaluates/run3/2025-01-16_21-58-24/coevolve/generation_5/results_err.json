  "description": "Design a hybrid optimization heuristic for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) that employs a probabilistic sampling mechanism to explore diverse solution landscapes. The heuristic should integrate a precise fitness function that evaluates candidate solutions based on a weighted combination of item values and adherence to multi-dimensional constraints. The algorithm must balance exploration with exploitation by incorporating adaptive evolutionary computation to refine promising candidate solutions and a robust local search algorithm to fine-tune the final solution. The heuristic should enforce strict adherence to the MKP's weight and volume constraints, and it should provide detailed performance metrics to quantify the efficiency and effectiveness of the optimization process.",
