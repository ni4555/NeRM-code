Description:
Develop a hybrid optimization heuristic for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) that employs a combination of stochastic solution sampling, adaptive evolutionary computation, and robust local search algorithms. This heuristic should maximize the total prize collected by selecting a subset of items, while adhering to strict multi-dimensional weight and volume constraints. The approach will utilize probabilistic sampling to explore diverse solution landscapes and incorporate adaptive evolutionary strategies to exploit promising regions. The heuristic will define a precise fitness metric to evaluate candidate solutions, rigorously enforce MKP constraints, and focus on achieving a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. The performance goal is to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with minimal computational resources.

        selected_prize = np.sum(prize[x > 0])
        # Calculate the total weight for the selected items
        selected_weight = np.sum(weight[x > 0], axis=1)
        # Check if the total weight is within the constraints
        if np.all(selected_weight <= 1):

        else:
            return -np.inf  # Return negative infinity if constraints are violated

    # Initialize the bounds for each item, where 0 means the item is not selected and 1 means it is selected
    bounds = [(0, 1) for _ in range(weight.shape[0])]
