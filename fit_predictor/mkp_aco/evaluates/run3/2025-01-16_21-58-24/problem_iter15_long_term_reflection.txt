1. Prioritize high-value-to-weight with sparsity; blend randomness and constraint penalties.
2. Normalize factors, simplify, and balance with percentile thresholds.
3. Use domain-specific penalties, IQR for outliers, and control randomness.
4. Simplify, reduce noise, enforce constraints, and focus on core factors.
5. Normalize properly, avoid redundancy, and integrate domain knowledge.
