1. Prioritize diverse item factors, adapt weights, & balance exploration.
2. Minimize redundancy, use adaptive penalties, & normalize heuristics.
3. Introduce randomness, enhance diversity, & penalize outliers.
4. Refine balance, simplify criteria, & tailor weight considerations.
5. Normalize factors, apply consistent mutation, & use granular penalties.
6. Optimize diversity, balance exploration-exploitation, & avoid local optima.
7. Simplify heuristics, focus on core factors, & optimize performance.
