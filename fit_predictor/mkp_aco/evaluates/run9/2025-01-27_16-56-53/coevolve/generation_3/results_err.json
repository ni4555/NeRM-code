  "description": "Optimizing the selection of item subsets in a multi-dimensional knapsack problem by integrating adaptive metaheuristic-based stochastic sampling. This approach aims to maximize combined reward through enhanced exploration of the solution space, balancing exploitation and exploration while respecting stringent weight limits. The algorithm prioritizes high-value item combinations and dynamically adjusts heuristics to ensure compliance with dimension-specific weight constraints, mitigating the risk of local optima and improving overall performance.",
