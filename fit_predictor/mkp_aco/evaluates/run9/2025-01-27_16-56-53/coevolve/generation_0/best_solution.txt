Description:
Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) through stochastic solution sampling based on "heuristics". MKP involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total prize collected, subject to multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    m = weight.shape[1]
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(prize)
    for i in range(prize.shape[0]):
        heuristics[i] = prize[i] / np.sum(weight[i])
    return heuristics
