Description:
An advanced optimization technique tailored for the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) introduces a novel metaheuristic framework that synergizes stochastic search with adaptive adjustment strategies. This approach optimally balances both exploration and exploitation, strategically targeting high-value item clusters while rigorously adhering to weight constraints. By ingeniously incorporating randomness into the search process and continually refining heuristic algorithms, the algorithm mitigates the trapping in local optima, effectively broadening the search horizon and ultimately achieving superior performance by maximizing cumulative rewards under strict weight limitations.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)
    
    # Initialize random state for reproducibility
    np.random.seed(42)
    
    # Generate random indices for items
    indices = np.random.choice(n, size=int(n/2), replace=False)
    
    # Calculate heuristic values based on prize and weight
    for i in indices:
        for j in range(m):
            if weight[i, j] <= 1:
                heuristics[i] += prize[i] / weight[i, j]
    
    # Normalize heuristic values
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
