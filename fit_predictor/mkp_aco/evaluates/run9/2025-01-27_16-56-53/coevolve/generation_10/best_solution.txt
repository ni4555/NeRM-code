Description:
Developing a robust multi-dimensional knapsack optimization algorithm with an adaptive stochastic framework, which effectively balances exploration and exploitation through dynamic heuristic adaptation. This innovative solution leverages real-time adaptive prioritization of valuable subsets, integrates advanced stochastic sampling techniques for diverse item exploration, and incorporates anti-local optima mechanisms to ensure peak performance in intricate multi-dimensional problem spaces.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    
    # Initialize heuristic scores based on prize and normalized weight
    heuristic_scores = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Introduce stochastic elements and anti-local optima mechanisms
    random_noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, (n,))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            # Apply adaptive stochastic sampling
            noise = random_noise[i] * weight[i, j]
            # Update heuristic based on noisy weight
            heuristic_scores[i] *= (1 - noise) + (noise * (prize[i] / (weight[i, j] + noise)))
    
    # Balance exploration and exploitation using dynamic heuristic adaptation
    heuristic_scores /= np.sum(heuristic_scores)
    
    # Integrate anti-local optima mechanisms by adding a penalty to local optima
    anti_local_penalty = np.where(np.argmax(heuristic_scores) == np.argmax(heuristic_scores), -1, 0)
    heuristic_scores += anti_local_penalty
    
    return heuristic_scores
