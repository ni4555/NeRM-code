Description:
The MDKP is addressed through a probabilistic metaheuristic framework, employing sophisticated stochastic sampling to meticulously select item subsets for maximized reward accumulation. This framework is designed with an adaptive mechanism that continually tunes its heuristic strategies, balancing a nuanced blend of exploration and exploitation. The algorithm prioritizes item combinations with high potential value while rigorously adhering to dimension-specific weight constraints to avoid陷入局部最优解。 Advanced optimization techniques are integrated to dynamically adapt to changes in item availability and weight limitations, ensuring the robustness of the solution against stochastic fluctuations and the flexibility to respond to evolving problem dynamics.

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the heuristic values
    heuristics_dict = {}
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible prize for each dimension
    max_dimension_prize = np.max(prize)
    
    # Create a list of all possible item combinations
    item_combinations = np.array([i for i in range(weight.shape[0])])
    
    # Iterate over each combination to calculate the heuristic value
    for i in item_combinations:
        for j in item_combinations:
            if i != j:
                combined_weight = weight[i] + weight[j]
                if np.all(combined_weight <= 1):
                    combined_prize = prize[i] + prize[j]
                    if combined_prize > max_dimension_prize:
                        heuristics_dict[i] = combined_prize
                else:
                    break

    return np.array([heuristics_dict.get(i, 0) for i in range(prize.shape[0])])
