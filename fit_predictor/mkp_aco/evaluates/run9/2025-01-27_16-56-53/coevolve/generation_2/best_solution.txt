Description:
Optimizing the selection of diverse item subsets in Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problems (MKP) to maximize combined reward, leveraging advanced combinatorial optimization techniques and metaheuristics for comprehensive exploration of the solution space. This approach ensures adherence to strict multi-dimensional weight constraints and prioritizes high-value item combinations, employing cumulative calculations and emphasizing item subset diversity for optimal prize accumulation.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    heuristic = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if weight[i, j] > 1:
                return None  # Constraints not met
        heuristic[i] = prize[i] / np.sum(weight[i])
    return heuristic
