Description:
Optimizing the selection of diverse item subsets for maximizing combined reward in Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problems through adaptive heuristic-based stochastic solution sampling. This approach integrates advanced combinatorial optimization techniques, incorporating metaheuristics for enhanced exploration of the solution space, while ensuring adherence to stringent multi-dimensional weight limits and prioritizing high-value item combinations for optimal prize accumulation.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Initialize the heuristics array with zeros
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(prize)
    
    # Calculate the total weight for each dimension
    total_weight = np.sum(weight, axis=0)
    
    # Calculate the cumulative prize and weight for each item
    cumulative_prize = np.zeros_like(prize)
    cumulative_weight = np.zeros_like(prize)
    cumulative_prize[0] = prize[0]
    cumulative_weight[0] = weight[0, 0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(prize)):
        cumulative_prize[i] = cumulative_prize[i-1] + prize[i]
        cumulative_weight[i] = cumulative_weight[i-1] + weight[i, 0]
    
    # Iterate over each item and calculate the heuristics value
    for i in range(len(prize)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(prize)):
            # Check if adding the next item would exceed the weight limit
            if cumulative_weight[j] <= total_weight[0]:
                # Calculate the heuristic value as the difference in prize
                heuristics[i] = max(heuristics[i], cumulative_prize[j] - cumulative_prize[i])
    
    return heuristics
