1. Prioritize diverse item factors, adapt weights dynamically.
2. Minimize redundancy, normalize consistently, balance exploration & exploitation.
3. Introduce randomness, enhance diversity, and penalize outliers effectively.
4. Refine heuristics, simplify criteria, and tailor weight considerations.
5. Use vectorized operations, avoid redundancy, and focus on meaningful metrics.
