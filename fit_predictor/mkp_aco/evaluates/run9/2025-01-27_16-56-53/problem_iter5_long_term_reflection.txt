1. Integrate diverse factors, normalize, and adapt dynamically.
2. Emphasize value-to-weight, sparsity, and adapt exploration.
3. Use sparsity to promote diversity, balance with exploitation.
4. Dynamically adjust thresholds, incorporate randomness.
5. Normalize heuristics, focus on multi-factor evaluation.
