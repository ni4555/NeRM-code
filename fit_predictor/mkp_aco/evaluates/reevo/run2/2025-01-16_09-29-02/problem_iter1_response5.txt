```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_prize = prize / np.max(prize)
    density = np.sum(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight)
    risk_factor = np.min(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    return normalized_prize * density * (1 - risk_factor)
```
