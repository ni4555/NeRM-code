    # Calculate the maximum prize and average weight for each item
    max_prize = np.max(prize)
    average_weight = np.mean(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate density based on prize and average weight
    density = prize / average_weight
    
    # Calculate constraint balance for each item
    constraint_balance = np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
