    normalized_prize = prize / np.sum(prize)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    balance = (np.max(weight, axis=1) - np.min(weight, axis=1)) / np.max(weight, axis=1)
    sparsity = 1 - np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    heuristics = normalized_prize * density * balance * sparsity
