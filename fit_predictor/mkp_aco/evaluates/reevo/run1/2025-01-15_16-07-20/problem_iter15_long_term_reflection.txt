1. Balance value and weight, normalize scores; integrate sparsity and dynamic features.
2. Use non-linear factors, domain insights; focus on meaningful features, objective balance.
3. Normalize inputs, diverse factors; avoid redundancy; balance output, fairness.
4. Emphasize problem-specific features; balance variance; use normalization and penalties.
