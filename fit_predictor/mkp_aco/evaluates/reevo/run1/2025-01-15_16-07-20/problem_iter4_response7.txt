```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_prize = prize / np.sum(prize)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    complexity = np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    sparsity_score = np.prod(1 - weight, axis=1)
    return (normalized_prize + density - complexity + sparsity_score) * (1 - np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2)
