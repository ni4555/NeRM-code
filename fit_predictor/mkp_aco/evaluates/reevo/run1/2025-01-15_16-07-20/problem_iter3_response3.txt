```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_prize = prize / np.sum(prize)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    complexity = np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    sparsity = (np.sum(weight, axis=1) == 1)  # Only consider items with single weight dimension
    dimension_factors = np.sum(weight, axis=0) / np.sum(weight, axis=0)**2
    return (normalized_prize + density - complexity) * sparsity * dimension_factors
