1. Consider multi-dimensional constraints.
2. Aggregate performance across dimensions.
3. Use thresholding based on aggregated measures.
4. Introduce sparsification factors.
5. Normalize with respect to overall performance.
Consider normalized values, balance weight distribution, and utilize max weights.
Incorporate dimension-specific value insights and sparsity factors more directly.
Use statistical measures appropriately, avoid complex corrections, and focus on simple, robust heuristics.
Consider global context, normalize, balance multiple criteria, ensure positivity.
Focus on balance between sparsity and informativeness, normalize appropriately, and avoid unnecessary transformations.
Use simpler metrics and focus on direct relationship between item value and weight.
- Utilize more meaningful ratios (e.g., per weight or global scale).
- Consider combining multiple attributes.
- Apply domain-specific transformations.
Use non-linear scaling and threshold-based filtering for sparsity.
Utilize normalization, aggregation, and weighted combinations for heuristic strength.
1. Consider the cumulative impact of item attributes.
2. Normalize ratios for better comparison.
3. Use statistical measures for thresholding.
4. Avoid excessive smoothing.
Balance profit-to-weight ratio with normalized value.
Consider heuristic simplicity and directness. Avoid unnecessary normalization or filtering that may mask beneficial item attributes.
Use domain knowledge to create a multi-criteria heuristic. Normalize inputs, consider inverses for constraints, and combine weighted features.
Leverage normalization, account for sparsity, and use adaptive thresholds.
Consider simplicity, use domain knowledge, and minimize data transformation steps.
Consider using non-linear transformations, and incorporate domain-specific knowledge to filter candidates effectively.
Consider using a more nuanced scoring system, incorporate diverse factors, and apply smoothing techniques.
Use normalization, consider dimension-specific weights, and apply thresholding for robustness.
1. Incorporate multiple metrics (prize/weight, weight distribution).
2. Adjust for individual item characteristics.
3. Combine heuristics to enhance sparsity and fairness.
4. Use meaningful thresholds based on the data distribution.
Focus on relative values, avoid normalization, and directly relate heuristics to item importance.
Use normalized values, incorporate sparsity, and account for variability.
Incorporate diversity (std_dev), maintain sparsity, normalize, and adjust to problem scale.
1. Normalize values appropriately.
2. Use distribution awareness (max weight).
3. Adjust for sparsity and variability.
4. Combine heuristics for a balance.
Optimize heuristic design by:
- Use a clear normalization of item value.
- Focus on weight contribution relative to total.
- Minimize unnecessary complexity and operations.
Simplify heuristics, consider item weight directly, and avoid complex transformations.
Incorporate value-to-weight ratio and normalize to a cumulative probability, sparsify with a dynamic threshold.
- Incorporate sparsity through weighted statistics.
- Consider normalized values for balance and robustness.
- Normalize individual item importance for dimension independence.
Focus on simplicity, directly measure feasibility, and minimize unnecessary computations.
Avoid normalization; focus on raw ratios; threshold-based sparsification is too aggressive.
