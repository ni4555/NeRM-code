1. Emphasize value-to-weight ratios, normalize, and apply domain insights with simplicity.
2. Optimize non-linear scaling, apply thresholds, and enhance sparsity.
3. Use diverse metrics, balance global & local, and maintain item sparsity.
4. Focus on item features, non-linear scaling, and domain simplification.
5. Normalize ratios, apply non-linear transformations, and filter for diversity.
