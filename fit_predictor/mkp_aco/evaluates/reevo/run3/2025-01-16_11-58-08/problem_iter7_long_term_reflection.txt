1. Prioritize core value-to-weight ratios, normalize for sparsity, and apply domain insights simply.
2. Balance normalization and variance, avoid thresholds, and keep complexity low.
3. Use diverse metrics, balance global & local info, and maintain sparsity & diversity.
4. Focus on item-specific features, non-linear scaling, and domain-knowledge-driven simplification.
5. Normalize for scale, balance sparsity, and use multiple features with non-linear transformations.
