```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the sum of weights for each item
    weight_sum = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Calculate the heuristic value as the ratio of prize to total weight
    heuristics = prize / weight_sum
    # Normalize the heuristics by the maximum heuristic value to ensure all heuristics are in the same range
    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristics)
    # Apply a sigmoid function to smooth the heuristics and maintain the relative ranking
    heuristics = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-heuristics / max_heuristic))
    return heuristics
