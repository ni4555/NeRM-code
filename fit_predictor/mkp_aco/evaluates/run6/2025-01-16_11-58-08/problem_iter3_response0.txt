```python

    # Calculate value-to-weight ratios
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Normalize the ratios to sum to 1
    normalized_ratio = ratio / np.sum(ratio)

    threshold = 0.1  # Example threshold
    sparsified_ratio = np.where(normalized_ratio > threshold, normalized_ratio, 0)
