```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate value-to-weight ratios and normalize to ensure all values are between 0 and 1
    ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    normalized_ratio = (ratio - np.min(ratio)) / (np.max(ratio) - np.min(ratio))
    return normalized_ratio
