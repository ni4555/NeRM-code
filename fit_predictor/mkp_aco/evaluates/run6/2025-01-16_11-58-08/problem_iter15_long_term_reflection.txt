1. Prioritize item value, normalize, and introduce sparsity and diversity.
2. Simplify transformations, focus on core metrics, and manage variance.
3. Amplify high-value features, balance diversity, and control sparsity with thresholds.
4. Use normalization, log scaling, and sparsity-inducing operations to balance objectives.
5. Incorporate randomness for diversity, normalize, and tune heuristics dynamically.
