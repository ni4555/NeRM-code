```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate normalized prize to weight ratio for each item
    normalized_ratio = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    # Normalize the ratios to sum to 1 to account for the multi-dimensional constraint
    heuristics = normalized_ratio / np.sum(normalized_ratio, axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
    return heuristics
