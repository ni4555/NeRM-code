1. Blend diverse normalized criteria, leveraging sparsity for high-value prioritization.
2. Sample adaptively with stochastic elements, focusing on logarithmic sparsity.
3. Dynamically adjust multi-dimensional sorting and thresholds based on heuristic contributions.
4. Normalize inputs and balance heuristics to optimize complexity and balance.
