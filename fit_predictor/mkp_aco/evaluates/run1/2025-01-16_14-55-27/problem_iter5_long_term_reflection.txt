1. Blend diverse criteria, normalize dynamically, and focus on top sparsified candidates.
2. Integrate stochastic sampling, logarithmic sparsity, and weighted ratio analysis.
3. Optimize multi-dimensional sorting with cumulative prize and dynamic capacity checks.
4. Use sparsity and normalization to streamline complexity and balance decision-making.
