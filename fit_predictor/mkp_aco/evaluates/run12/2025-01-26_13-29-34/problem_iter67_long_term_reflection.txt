1. Blend heuristics & adapt learning dynamically; ensure feasibility first.
2. Balance DRL exploration with PSO efficiency; refine rewards smartly.
3. Focus on early feasibility checks & sparsity to reduce complexity.
4. Dynamically refine heuristics with real-time feedback and thresholding.
5. Optimize balance of exploration-exploitation; leverage PSO diversity.
