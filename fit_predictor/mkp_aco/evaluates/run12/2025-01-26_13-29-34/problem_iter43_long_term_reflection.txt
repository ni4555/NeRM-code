1. Blend diverse optimization sources, weigh history, & adapt dynamically.
2. Integrate feedback, balance sparsity, & adapt rewards.
3. Optimize for feasibility, sparsity, & adaptive learning.
4. Refine rewards, balance DRL & PSO, & maintain feasibility.
5. Leverage evolutionary insights, adapt rewards, & balance E&E.
