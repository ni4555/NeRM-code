1. Blend RL, PSO, and domain-specific heuristics for MOKP.
2. Minimize complexity with adaptive filtering and reinforcement.
3. Prioritize feasibility, sparsify heuristics, and balance objectives.
4. Integrate feedback, adapt parameters, and optimize swarm intelligence.
5. Simplify, focus on feasible regions, and reduce redundant computations.
