1. Integrate DRL and PSO through interactive learning, adaptive sparsity, and refined rewards.
2. Use nuanced DRL rewards, PSO's global best, early constraint filtering, and balanced exploration.
3. Normalize and balance heuristics, integrate diversity to prevent overfitting, adapt sparsity, and leverage feedback.
4. Early constraint-checking, dynamic sparsity, and balanced exploration-exploitation for adaptability.
5. Prioritize feasibility, use percentile-based thresholds, and dynamically refine rewards for continuous improvement.
