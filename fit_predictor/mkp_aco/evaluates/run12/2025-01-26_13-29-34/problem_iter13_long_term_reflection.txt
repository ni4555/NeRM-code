1. Craft nuanced reward functions with context and domain-specific penalties.
2. Balance RL's reward updates with PSO's swarm intelligence for convergence.
3. Dynamically adapt sparsity based on heuristic performance and percentile thresholds.
4. Integrate constraint-aware filtering and adapt sparsity dynamically to maintain feasibility.
5. Enhance exploration-exploitation balance in RL and PSO for optimal search.
