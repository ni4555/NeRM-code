1. Adapt schedules to learning curves, prioritize feasible solutions.
2. Foster diversity, refine with performance metrics, balance exp/rex.
3. Sparsify with dynamic thresholds, update rewards adaptively.
4. Leverage PSO for exploration, refine heuristics based on variance.
5. Integrate diverse feedback, refine adaptive schedules, focus on feasible.
