  "description": "Integrating an adaptive constraint-driven filtering mechanism with a cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning model, this advanced optimization framework for the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) harnesses the power of particle swarm optimization to achieve optimal decision-making in real-time. The framework is designed to dynamically balance computational efficiency with robust adaptability in rapidly changing environments. The primary objective is to maximize the aggregate value of selected items while adhering to complex multi-dimensional weight constraints. Furthermore, the framework employs innovative strategy adjustment techniques to ensure ongoing feasibility and efficiently explore a wide range of diverse solutions.",
