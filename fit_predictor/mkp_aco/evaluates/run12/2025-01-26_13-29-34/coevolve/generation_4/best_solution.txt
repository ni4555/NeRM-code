Description:
Integrating an adaptive constraint-driven filtering mechanism with a cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning model, this advanced optimization framework for the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) harnesses the power of particle swarm optimization to achieve optimal decision-making in real-time. The framework is designed to dynamically balance computational efficiency with robust adaptability in rapidly changing environments. The primary objective is to maximize the aggregate value of selected items while adhering to complex multi-dimensional weight constraints. Furthermore, the framework employs innovative strategy adjustment techniques to ensure ongoing feasibility and efficiently explore a wide range of diverse solutions.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the inverse of the weight sum for each item
    inv_weight_sum = 1.0 / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the heuristics based on the inverse weight sum and prize
    heuristics = prize * inv_weight_sum
    
    # Apply a particle swarm optimization approach to adjust heuristics
    # This is a simplified PSO and should be replaced with a real PSO algorithm in practice
    for _ in range(10):  # Number of iterations in PSO
        r1, r2 = np.random.randn(len(prize)), np.random.randn(len(prize))
        cognitiveComponent = np.random.rand(len(prize)) * heuristics
        socialComponent = np.random.rand(len(prize)) * np.max(heuristics)
        velocity = cognitiveComponent + socialComponent
        heuristics += velocity
    
    # Normalize the heuristics to ensure they sum to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
