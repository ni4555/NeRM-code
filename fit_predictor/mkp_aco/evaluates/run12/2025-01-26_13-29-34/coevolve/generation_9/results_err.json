  "description": "Developing an integrated optimization framework for the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) that employs a deep reinforcement learning-based real-time decision-making system. This system is supported by an adaptive constraint-driven filtering mechanism to ensure multi-dimensional feasibility in dynamic environments. Additionally, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is integrated for evolutionary swarm intelligence, aiming to strike a balance between computational efficiency and adaptability. The framework should aim to maximize the total prize collection while adhering to multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints, and it should be evaluated on its ability to consistently produce near-optimal solutions with high fitness scores in scenarios where the problem constraints evolve over time.",
