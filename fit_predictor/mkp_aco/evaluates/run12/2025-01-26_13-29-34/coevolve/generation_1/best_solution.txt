Description:
Optimizing MKP with a novel hybrid stochastic search algorithm leveraging advanced machine learning heuristics and adaptive constraint-based selection strategies, ensuring an integrated solution approach that balances computational efficiency and robustness through dynamic probability distribution adjustment and evolutionary population optimization techniques.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    heuristic_values = np.zeros(n)
    
    # Initialize a dynamic probability distribution
    probability_distribution = np.ones(n) / n
    
    # Adaptive constraint-based selection strategy
    for _ in range(100):  # Number of iterations can be adjusted for performance
        selected_indices = np.random.choice(n, size=m, replace=False, p=probability_distribution)
        
        # Calculate the potential of each item based on machine learning heuristics
        potential = np.dot(prize[selected_indices], weight[selected_indices])
        
        # Update the heuristic values based on potential and adaptive strategies
        heuristic_values += potential / (m + 1)
        
        # Adjust the probability distribution based on the updated heuristic values
        probability_distribution = heuristic_values / heuristic_values.sum()
        
        # Keep the probability distribution within bounds
        probability_distribution = np.clip(probability_distribution, 0.0001, 0.9999)
