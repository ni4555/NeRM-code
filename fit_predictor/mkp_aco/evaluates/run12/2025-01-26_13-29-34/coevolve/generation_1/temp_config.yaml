description: Optimizing MKP with a novel hybrid stochastic search algorithm leveraging
  advanced machine learning heuristics and adaptive constraint-based selection strategies,
  ensuring an integrated solution approach that balances computational efficiency
  and robustness through dynamic probability distribution adjustment and evolutionary
  population optimization techniques.
