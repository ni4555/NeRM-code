description: Develop an integrated optimization framework that addresses the complexities
  of the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) by combining adaptive constraint-driven
  filtering and deep reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making. The framework
  should utilize a hybrid approach that incorporates particle swarm optimization (PSO)
  for evolutionary swarm intelligence, enabling a balance between computational efficiency
  and adaptability in dynamic environments. The objective is to maximize the total
  reward collected from a subset of items while adhering to strict multi-dimensional
  maximum weight constraints. The framework must be designed to effectively sample
  solutions for Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) using stochastic heuristics, ensuring
  a robust solution strategy that minimizes the risk of premature convergence and
  optimizes the trade-off between solution quality and computational effort.
