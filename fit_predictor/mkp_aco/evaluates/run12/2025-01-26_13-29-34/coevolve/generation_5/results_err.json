  "description": "Develop an integrated optimization framework that addresses the complexities of the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) by combining adaptive constraint-driven filtering and deep reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making. The framework should utilize a hybrid approach that incorporates particle swarm optimization (PSO) for evolutionary swarm intelligence, enabling a balance between computational efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments. The objective is to maximize the total reward collected from a subset of items while adhering to strict multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints. The framework must be designed to effectively sample solutions for Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) using stochastic heuristics, ensuring a robust solution strategy that minimizes the risk of premature convergence and optimizes the trade-off between solution quality and computational effort.",
