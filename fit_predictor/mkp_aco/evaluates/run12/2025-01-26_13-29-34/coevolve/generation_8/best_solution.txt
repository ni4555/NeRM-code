Description:
Leveraging a synergistic blend of advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques for real-time decision optimization in the complex Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP), this innovative framework incorporates a dynamic constraint-violation filtering algorithm to guarantee multi-dimensional adherence. Enhanced with the incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to harness evolutionary swarm intelligence, the proposed solution dynamically optimizes the trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptability in fluctuating environments, thereby achieving peak performance in maximizing cumulative rewards while adhering to stringent weight constraints.

import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Initialize heuristic array
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(prize)
    
    # Initialize swarm particles (position and velocity)
    particles = {
        'position': np.copy(prize),
        'velocity': np.zeros_like(prize)
    }
    
    # Dynamic constraint-violation filtering algorithm
    constraints_violation = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    filtered_particles = {k: v for k, v in particles.items() if np.all(constraints_violation <= 1)}
    
    # Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) iteration
    for iteration in range(10):  # Assuming 10 iterations
        for i in range(len(prize)):
            # Update velocities
            particles['velocity'] = particles['velocity'] + np.random.randn(*particles['position'].shape) - np.random.randn(*particles['position'].shape)
            
            # Update positions based on velocities
            particles['position'] = particles['position'] + particles['velocity']
            
            # Apply constraint-violation filtering
            constraints_violation = np.sum(weight, axis=1)
