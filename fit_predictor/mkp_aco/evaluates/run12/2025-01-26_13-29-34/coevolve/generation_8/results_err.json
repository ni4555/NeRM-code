  "description": "Leveraging a synergistic blend of advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques for real-time decision optimization in the complex Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP), this innovative framework incorporates a dynamic constraint-violation filtering algorithm to guarantee multi-dimensional adherence. Enhanced with the incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to harness evolutionary swarm intelligence, the proposed solution dynamically optimizes the trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptability in fluctuating environments, thereby achieving peak performance in maximizing cumulative rewards while adhering to stringent weight constraints.",
