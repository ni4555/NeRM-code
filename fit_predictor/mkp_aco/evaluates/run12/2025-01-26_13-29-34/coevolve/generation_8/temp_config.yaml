description: Leveraging a synergistic blend of advanced deep reinforcement learning
  techniques for real-time decision optimization in the complex Multi-Objective Knapsack
  Problem (MOKP), this innovative framework incorporates a dynamic constraint-violation
  filtering algorithm to guarantee multi-dimensional adherence. Enhanced with the
  incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to harness evolutionary swarm
  intelligence, the proposed solution dynamically optimizes the trade-off between
  computational efficiency and adaptability in fluctuating environments, thereby achieving
  peak performance in maximizing cumulative rewards while adhering to stringent weight
  constraints.
