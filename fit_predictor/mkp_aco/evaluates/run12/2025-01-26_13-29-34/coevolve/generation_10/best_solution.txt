Description:
Innovating an advanced optimization system for the Multiple Knapsack Problem, this framework synergizes deep reinforcement learning with dynamic adaptation to ensure feasibility through constraint-driven filtering, while concurrently leveraging particle swarm optimization for robust evolutionary problem-solving. This system emphasizes optimizing a multi-objective, real-time performance through an elegant balance of computational prowess and adaptability in complex environments.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Convert weights to a probability distribution based on item weight
    probabilities = weight / weight.sum()
    
    # Initialize heuristic array with 0s
    heuristics = np.zeros_like(prize)
    
    # Use a simple heuristic that considers prize value and probability
    heuristics = heuristics + prize * probabilities
    
    # Filter out items that do not fit in a single dimension
    for item in range(prize.shape[0]):
        if weight[item].sum() > 1:
            heuristics[item] = 0
    
    return heuristics
