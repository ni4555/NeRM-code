description: Innovating an advanced optimization system for the Multiple Knapsack
  Problem, this framework synergizes deep reinforcement learning with dynamic adaptation
  to ensure feasibility through constraint-driven filtering, while concurrently leveraging
  particle swarm optimization for robust evolutionary problem-solving. This system
  emphasizes optimizing a multi-objective, real-time performance through an elegant
  balance of computational prowess and adaptability in complex environments.
