Description:
Developing an integrated optimization platform for addressing the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem, integrating a blend of neural reinforcement learning for real-time adaptation, an adaptive multi-dimensional constraint validation algorithm for maintaining multi-level constraint adherence, and an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm leveraging collective intelligence to balance speed and adaptability in the face of intricate weight and value restrictions across dynamic environments.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the sum of each item's weight across all dimensions
    weight_sum = weight.sum(axis=1)
    
    # Normalize the prize value by the sum of weights
    normalized_prize = prize / weight_sum
    
    # Calculate heuristic as a product of normalized prize and weight sum
    heuristic = normalized_prize * weight_sum
    
    return heuristic
