Description:
Developing a comprehensive optimization solution for the Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) that incorporates a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-making system for real-time adjustments. This system must ensure multi-dimensional feasibility through an adaptive constraint-driven filtering mechanism. Additionally, the solution should integrate particle swarm optimization to harness evolutionary swarm intelligence, aiming to strike a balance between computational efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments while avoiding the pitfalls of stochastic sampling and vague "heuristics." The algorithm must specify advanced integration strategies, performance objectives, and demonstrate novel algorithmic innovations for solving MOKP effectively and efficiently.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n = prize.shape[0]
    m = weight.shape[1]
    # Initialize heuristics to the lowest possible float
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)
    # Apply a simple greedy heuristic considering each weight dimension
    for item in range(n):
        heuristics[item] = prize[item] / weight[item].sum()
    return heuristics
