description: Developing an advanced, adaptive optimization framework for the Multi-Objective
  Knapsack Problem (MOKP) that integrates deep reinforcement learning for real-time
  decision-making, employs adaptive constraint-driven filtering to maintain multi-dimensional
  feasibility, and leverages particle swarm optimization for evolutionary swarm intelligence,
  ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and adaptability in dynamic
  environments.
