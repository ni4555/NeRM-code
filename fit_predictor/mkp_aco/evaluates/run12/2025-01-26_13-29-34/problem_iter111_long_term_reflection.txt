1. Pre-filter infeasible items to reduce unnecessary computations.
2. Integrate diverse performance measures for balanced exploration.
3. Adaptively refine rewards and parameters based on recent performance.
4. Use percentile thresholds for heuristic sparsity and exploration balance.
5. Continuously update heuristics with recent findings for dynamic adaptation.
