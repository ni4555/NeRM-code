importance of the prize and weight.

New Algorithm Sentence: **Calculate heuristics matrix by dividing the sum of normalized prizes by the minimum normalized weight for each item.**

Python Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize, weight):
    n = len(prize)
    m = len(weight[0])
    norm_prize = np.sum(prize) / n
    min_weight = np.min(weight, axis=1)
    norm_min_weight = np.min(min_weight)
    heuristics_matrix = norm_prize / norm_min_weight
    return heuristics_matrix
