```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_prize = prize / np.sum(prize)
    average_weight = np.mean(weight, axis=1)
    density = normalized_prize / average_weight
    sparsity = (density > 1 / np.sum(weight)) * 1.0
    utility_score = density * sparsity
    return utility_score
