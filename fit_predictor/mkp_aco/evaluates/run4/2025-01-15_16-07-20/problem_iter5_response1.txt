```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the maximum prize and average weight for each item
    max_prize = np.max(prize)
    average_weight = np.mean(weight, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate density based on prize and average weight
    density = prize / average_weight
    
    # Calculate dimension-specific factors
    dimension_factors = np.sum(weight, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    
    # Calculate utility considering both density and dimension-specific factors
    utility = density * dimension_factors
    
    # Normalize utility to ensure it's within a certain range to avoid overfitting
    utility_normalized = (utility - np.min(utility)) / (np.max(utility) - np.min(utility))
    
    # Calculate sparsity based on the ratio of utility to maximum prize
    sparsity = (utility_normalized > 0.5) * 1.0

    return utility_normalized * sparsity
