```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_prize = prize / np.sum(prize)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    sparsity = 1 - np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    complexity = np.sum(weight**2, axis=1) / np.sum(weight, axis=1)**2
    
    combined_score = normalized_prize * density * sparsity / (1 + complexity)
    return combined_score
