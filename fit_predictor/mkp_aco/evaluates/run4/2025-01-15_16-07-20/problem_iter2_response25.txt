```python
def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    max_prize = np.max(prize)
    density = prize / np.sum(weight, axis=1)
    balance = np.mean(weight, axis=1) < np.sum(weight, axis=1) / n
    variance = np.var(weight, axis=1) < np.var(weight)
    sparsity = (density > max_prize / np.sum(weight)) * 1.0
    return density * sparsity * balance * variance
