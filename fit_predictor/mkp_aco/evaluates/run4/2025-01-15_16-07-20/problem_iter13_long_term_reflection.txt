- Balance item value and weight constraints, normalize scores for clarity.
- Integrate sparsity, adapt dynamically, and simplify complex features.
- Use non-linear transformations and leverage domain insights to enhance heuristics.
- Focus on meaningful features, balance objectives, and normalize consistently.
