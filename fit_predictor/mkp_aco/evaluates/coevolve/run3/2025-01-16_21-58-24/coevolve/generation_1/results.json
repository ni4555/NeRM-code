  "description": "Employing a hybrid stochastic optimization framework, we aim to solve the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) by integrating advanced heuristic-based sampling techniques with dynamic programming and metaheuristics. This approach leverages a combination of random sampling, evolutionary algorithms, and local search strategies to efficiently explore the solution space, ensuring both diversity and convergence towards optimal or near-optimal solutions while respecting the complex weight and capacity constraints of the MKP.",
