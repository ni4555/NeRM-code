  "description": "Solving the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) using a hybrid optimization framework that combines random sampling, evolutionary algorithms, and local search strategies. The framework integrates advanced heuristic-based techniques with dynamic programming to efficiently explore the solution space. The heuristic rationale involves leveraging diversity and convergence towards optimal or near-optimal solutions while respecting complex weight and capacity constraints. The algorithmic specifics include a probabilistic selection of item subsets, evolutionary genetic operators for adaptation, and local search methods for fine-tuning solutions, ensuring both exploration and exploitation in the search process.",
