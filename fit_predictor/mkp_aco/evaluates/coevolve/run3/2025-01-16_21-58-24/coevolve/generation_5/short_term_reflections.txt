Hint: Clarify heuristic rationale, detail optimization strategies, and emphasize problem-specific criteria.
1. Specify heuristic design principles.
2. Clarify constraints and problem goals.
3. Describe specific algorithmic strategies.
4. Highlight key performance metrics.
Clarity on heuristic objective, specific heuristic type, and constraint consideration.
1. Specify algorithmic details.
2. Clarify problem constraints.
3. Emphasize performance metrics.
4. Provide algorithmic context.
Key description elements for better performance:
- Specific heuristic (normalized profit-weight product)
- Focus on maximizing total prize under constraints

Potential pitfalls in the worse description:
- Lack of specific heuristic, leading to random solutions
- General and vague performance assessment (synergistically, meticulously)

Algorithmic insights better captured:
- Use of normalized values for item selection
- Direct mention of prize maximization and weight constraints

Better design hints:
- Specify heuristic clearly
- Define performance measures concretely
- Include constraints in heuristic description
