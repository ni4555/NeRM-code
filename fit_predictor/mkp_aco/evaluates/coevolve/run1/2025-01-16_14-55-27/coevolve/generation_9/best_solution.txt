Description:
Develop a sophisticated heuristic for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem by implementing an adaptive dynamic sorting algorithm, incorporating a comprehensive weighted ratio analysis, and employing an intelligent sampling mechanism to maximize prize accumulation. The strategy should efficiently handle intricate weight constraints and multi-dimensional capacity limits. Furthermore, the approach must leverage advanced optimization techniques, such as greedy algorithms and heuristic-based search strategies, to significantly enhance performance and achieve optimal solution outcomes.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n, m = prize.shape[0], weight.shape[1]
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the weighted ratio for each item
    weighted_ratio = prize / weight.sum(axis=1)
    
    # Step 2: Use adaptive dynamic sorting to order items based on their weighted ratio
    # Here, we'll use a simple selection sort for demonstration purposes; however,
    # in a real-world scenario, a more sophisticated algorithm might be needed.
    indices = np.argsort(weighted_ratio)[::-1]  # Sort in descending order
    sorted_weighted_ratio = weighted_ratio[indices]
    sorted_prize = prize[indices]
    sorted_weight = weight[indices]
    
    # Step 3: Implement an intelligent sampling mechanism
    # For simplicity, we'll use a random sampling here; in practice, a more sophisticated
    # mechanism should be employed.
    sample_size = min(n, 10)  # Sample a subset of items to consider
    sampled_indices = np.random.choice(n, sample_size, replace=False)
    sampled_weighted_ratio = weighted_ratio[sampled_indices]
    sampled_prize = prize[sampled_indices]
    sampled_weight = weight[sampled_indices]
    
    # Step 4: Use a greedy algorithm to determine the heuristic value for each item
    # Initialize the heuristic array with zeros
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)
    
    # For each sampled item, check if adding it to the knapsack is beneficial
    for i in sampled_indices:
        # Check if the item fits into the knapsack based on all dimensions
        if np.all(weight[i] <= 1):
            # Update the heuristic value for the item
            heuristics[i] = sorted_weighted_ratio[i]
    
    # Step 5: Return the heuristics array
    return heuristics

# Example usage:
# n = 5
# m = 2
# prize = np.array([10, 40, 30, 50, 20])
# weight = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [1, 0], [0.2, 0.8], [0.4, 0.6], [0.1, 0.9]])
# heuristics = heuristics_v2(prize, weight)
# print(heuristics)
