  "description": "Develop a sophisticated heuristic for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem by implementing an adaptive dynamic sorting algorithm, incorporating a comprehensive weighted ratio analysis, and employing an intelligent sampling mechanism to maximize prize accumulation. The strategy should efficiently handle intricate weight constraints and multi-dimensional capacity limits. Furthermore, the approach must leverage advanced optimization techniques, such as greedy algorithms and heuristic-based search strategies, to significantly enhance performance and achieve optimal solution outcomes.",
