Description:
Optimizing a Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem with Adaptive Stochastic Sampling and Advanced Heuristic Algorithms, involving Dynamic Item Sorting and Weighted Ratio Analysis to Maximize Prize Collection While Efficiently Adapting to Complex Weight Constraints and Multi-dimensional Maximum Weight Limitations.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n = prize.shape[0]
    m = weight.shape[1]

    # Dynamic item sorting based on a heuristic, e.g., inverse of weighted prize ratio
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-prize / weight.sum(axis=1))

    # Initialize the heuristic values array
    heuristics = np.zeros(n)

    # Iterate over the sorted items and assign a heuristic value
    for i in sorted_indices:
        # Calculate the weighted ratio for the current item
        weighted_ratio = prize[i] / weight[i, :].sum()
        
        # Calculate the sum of current and previous heuristics
        current_sum = np.sum(heuristics[:i+1])
        
        # Calculate the heuristic for the current item based on the weighted ratio and previous sum
        heuristics[i] = weighted_ratio + current_sum

    # Normalize the heuristics so that they sum to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)

    return heuristics
