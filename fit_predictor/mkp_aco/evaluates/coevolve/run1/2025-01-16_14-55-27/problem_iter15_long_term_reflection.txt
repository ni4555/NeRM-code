1. Minimize complexity, dynamically adapt thresholds, and prioritize utility.
2. Normalize early, refine sparsity, and combine criteria effectively.
3. Use softmax for stability, avoid overflow, and validate assumptions.
4. Emphasize simplicity, sparsity, and dynamic thresholding for balance.
5. Prioritize item utility, optimize sorting, and normalize consistently.
