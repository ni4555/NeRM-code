1. Balance quality, diversity, and sparsity with adaptive metrics and domain insights.
2. Prioritize item-specific metrics, adapt thresholds, and use statistical filters.
3. Combine diverse measures, normalize scores, and dynamically adjust weights.
4. Focus on simple, intuitive heuristics, minimize redundancy, and use domain knowledge sparingly.
5. Integrate adaptive diversity and sparsity, normalize measures, and optimize thresholds.
