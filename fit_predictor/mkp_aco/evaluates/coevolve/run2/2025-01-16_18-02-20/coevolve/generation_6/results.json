  "description": "The heuristic employs a dynamic, multi-dimensional probabilistic model for MKP resolution, integrating advanced normalization techniques with a fine-grained per-unit-weight item ranking system. This refined approach leverages an adaptive stochastic sampling algorithm that optimally selects items based on their value-to-weight ratio, continuously optimizing the total prize under knapsack constraints. The algorithm strategically adjusts sampling parameters in real-time, ensuring a responsive and efficient adaptation to evolving knapsack capacities. Furthermore, it incorporates a state-of-the-art prioritization framework that emphasizes the selection of the most valuable items by weight, thereby significantly enhancing prize accumulation and the overall efficacy of the item selection process.",
