Description:
Optimizing Multi-dimensional Knapsack Solutions via Adaptive Stochastic Sampling and Advanced Metaheuristics, Incorporating Dynamic Weight Adjustment and Iterative Item Selection for Enhanced Prize Maximization and Constraint Compliance.

Code:
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Assuming that the weight constraint is fixed to 1 for each dimension
    # and that the weight array is shaped (n, m) where m is the dimension.
    # For simplicity, we assume that the prize array is of shape (n,).
    # The heuristics function will return the heuristics score for each item.
    
    # Calculate the sum of weights for each item, since each dimension's weight is fixed to 1
    total_weight_per_item = weight.sum(axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the prize per unit weight for each item
    prize_per_weight = prize / total_weight_per_item
    
    # Normalize the prize per unit weight to get heuristics values
    # We use np.clip to prevent division by zero and to keep the values in a reasonable range
    heuristics = np.clip(prize_per_weight, a_min=0, a_max=1)
    
    return heuristics
