  "description": "Designing an adaptive stochastic sampling heuristic for solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total prize collected, while adhering to multi-dimensional weight constraints. This approach leverages ranking by normalized value and incorporates stochastic sampling to iteratively explore solution spaces. The heuristic employs dynamic weight adjustment and a systematic item selection process to enhance prize maximization and ensure constraint compliance, resulting in an optimized set of items for each knapsack.",
