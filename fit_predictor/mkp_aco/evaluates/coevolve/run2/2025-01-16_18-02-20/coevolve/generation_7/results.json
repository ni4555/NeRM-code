  "description": "**Problem Description:**\n\nDesign a probabilistic optimization algorithm for the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP) that leverages a dynamic value-to-weight ratio heuristic to prioritize item selection. The algorithm shall employ a novel stochastic sampling technique to iteratively select items for each knapsack, ensuring that weight constraints are dynamically adjusted and refined throughout the optimization process. This approach will aim to maximize the total prize collected while adhering to strict weight limitations. The algorithm should incorporate advanced performance metrics and normalization techniques to enhance its robustness and scalability, enabling efficient solutions for large-scale MKP instances.",
