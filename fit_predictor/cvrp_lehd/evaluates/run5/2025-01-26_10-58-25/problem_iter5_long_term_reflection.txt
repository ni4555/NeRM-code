1. Balance penalties for demand and distance, ensuring capacity compliance.
2. Leverage domain-specific insights for simplified, efficient calculations.
3. Normalize and transform heuristics with softmax for balanced edge selection.
4. Incorporate capacity constraints early, penalizing infeasibility directly.
