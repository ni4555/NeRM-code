1. Prioritize constraint emphasis; balance penalties, normalize, and blend carefully.
2. Normalize early; apply non-linear transformations to highlight relevant factors.
3. Use blend ratios to control penalty impact and ensure heuristic diversity.
4. Optimize normalization and blending for stable heuristic values.
