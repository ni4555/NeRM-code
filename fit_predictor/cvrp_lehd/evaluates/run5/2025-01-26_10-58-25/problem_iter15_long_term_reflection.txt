1. Optimize demand and distance penalties with non-linear transformations.
2. Normalize within vehicle capacity for balanced heuristic values.
3. Integrate domain insights to tune parameters and transformations.
4. Use log-softmax normalization for non-negativity and scale balance.
5. Minimize redundant computations to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
