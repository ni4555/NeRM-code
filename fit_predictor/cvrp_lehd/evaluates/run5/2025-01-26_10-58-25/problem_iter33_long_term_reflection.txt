Design better heuristics for CVRP by:

- Prioritize constraints using non-linear emphasis, normalize factors, balance scales, and ensure positivity.
- Employ non-linear scaling for feature weight and normalization for balance.
- Use non-negative penalties, combine multi-criteria with normalization, and adapt weights dynamically.
- Invert non-linear scales to convert penalties into heuristic values.
