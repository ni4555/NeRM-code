- Blend factors for demand & distance; normalize to prevent dominance.
- Introduce non-linear dampening for distance; focus on local/global balance.
- Exclude depot from local factors; scale demand for problem invariance.
- Use vectorized ops for speed; dampen distance to counteract long-path bias.
- Normalize factors for non-negative weights; adjust demand to capacity ratios.
