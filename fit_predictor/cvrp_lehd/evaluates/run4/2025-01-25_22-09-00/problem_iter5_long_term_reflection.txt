1. Prioritize demand, balance scales, avoid negative weights, and exploit structure.
2. Scale with min_demand, dampen locally, and consider global trends.
3. Normalize for demand and distance, leverage non-linearity, and avoid loops.
4. Integrate diverse demand factors, balance local & global, and fine-tune dampening.
5. Normalize effectively, focus on relative values, and optimize computationally.
