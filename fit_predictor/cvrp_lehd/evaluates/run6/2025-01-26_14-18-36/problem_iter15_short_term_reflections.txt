3. Separate penalties from rewards.
4. Normalize based on local min and max.
Focus on balancing incentives, minimize penalties, and incorporate domain-specific factors.
Sort by demand, dampen distance penalties, and combine heuristic factors.
Focus on demand variability, distance, and vehicle capacity.
Pareto-optimization with penalties, prioritize high-demand nodes, scale carefully, and return on demand overflow.
Focus on demand scalability, dampen local preferences, balance feasibility and distance, and normalize consistently.
1. Accumulate demand for more informed edge weights.
2. Include both distance and demand-based penalties.
3. Normalize to avoid bias by large numbers.
4. Use cumulative demand for better capacity management.
5. Weigh penalties heavily for infeasible edges.
Refine edge penalties, integrate local preference, and combine heuristic & penalty vectors.
Avoid unnecessary calculations, prioritize penalties, and focus on capacity overflow and local preferences.
1. Utilize vectorized operations for efficiency.
2. Introduce penalties for infeasibility and trade-offs.
3. Combine multiple heuristics with a balance factor.
4. Normalize to maintain scale and interpretability.
Use penalties, not discounts, for undesirable edges. Blend penalties with a distance-based weight for more nuanced control.
Focus on balance, dampening, and infeasibility penalties.
Focus on sparsity, normalization, and penalties for infeasibility.
Focus on capacity, demand balance, and cost penalties.
Improve heuristic by sorting demands, using capacity as a filter, and normalizing values.
1. Combine multiple factors with careful consideration of dominance.
2. Use specific penalties for infeasible edges instead of global adjustments.
3. Prioritize local preferences and constraints.
4. Normalize heuristics effectively to avoid biases.
Incorporate cumulative demand, balance demand and distance, use penalties for infeasibilities, and normalize.
Incorporate multiple preferences, avoid explicit penalties, and normalize consistently.
1. Incorporate demand variation directly.
2. Use a dampening factor for balance.
3. Normalize based on a meaningful measure.
4. Penalize for infeasibilities explicitly.
5. Design for stability and robustness.
Leverage multiple penalty patterns, incorporate distance and demand decay, normalize, and tune weights.
1. Minimize complexity and intermediate steps.
2. Use preference for closer nodes and penalties effectively.
3. Normalize without introducing zero min heuristic.
Leverage node demand, remaining capacity, and dampened distance preferences.
1. Use demand and capacity constraints explicitly.
2. Incorporate diverse patterns and penalize deviations.
3. Apply decaying functions for priority and normalization.
4. Combine patterns with careful weighting and normalization.
Focus on balance, scale appropriately, and prioritize feasibility.
- Consider demand saturation penalties.
- Blend penalties for better balance.
- Weight penalties by distance for relevance.
- Avoid single maximum penalty threshold.
- Normalize heuristics for comparison consistency.
Incorporate penalties for demand infeasibility and distance, normalize carefully, use dampening factors, and avoid division by zero.
Focus on edge-specific attributes, dampen global effects, and balance infeasibilities.
Use local preference over global preference, stronger penalties for infeasible edges.
Focus on balancing preference and penalty, prefer higher demand and capacity, and penalize infeasibility explicitly.
- Prioritize edges with similar demand and shorter distances.
- Incorporate demand deviation from average.
- Balance distance and demand with dampening factors.
- Apply penalties for infeasibilities (capacity, high demand, distance).
- Normalize heuristics for consistent edge comparison.
