Design heuristics for CVRP by: 
- Early incorporating constraints, 
- Balancing global & local, 
- Using demand & distance, 
- Optimizing with vectorized operations,
- Leveraging precomputed stats & sparsity,
- Prioritizing high-demand, 
- Applying penalties for infeasibility,
- Minimizing loops & redundant computations,
- Exploiting domain knowledge,
- Incorporating diverse factors & diversification.
