- Prioritize cumulative demand over individual demand.
- Include distance penalties that consider depot proximity.
- Use both positive and negative incentives to guide search.
1. Focus on single criteria heuristics.
2. Combine criteria with penalties.
3. Normalize for comparison.
4. Use edge-specific features.
Use a blend of local demand, global capacity, and proximity to depot; adjust penalties based on specific conditions; introduce additional preferences; normalize carefully.
Focus on demand-based edge values, capacity penalties, and depot proximity.
Enhance heuristics by incorporating:
- Local preferences (distance penalties)
- Capacity penalties for demand overflow
- depot avoidance and normalized values
1. Use cumulative demand and capacity directly in heuristics.
2. Combine penalties into a single step.
3. Avoid redundant operations and normalize early.
4. Simplify with direct operations over boolean masks.
1. Simplify without loss of functionality.
2. Reduce unnecessary calculations.
3. Use direct indexing for penalties.
4. Avoid redundant dampening factors.
Combine dampening with penalties, favor local diversity, and balance global vs. local heuristics.
1. Integrate demand and distance heuristics.
2. Normalize edge penalties.
3. Use dampening factors for local preferences.
4. Combine weighted factors to balance heuristics.
Avoid redundant dampening and normalize only after all penalties.
1. Penalties should discourage undesirable behavior.
2. Preferences should favor desirable behavior.
3. Normalize to compare apples-to-apples.
4. Dampen to avoid getting stuck in local optima.
1. Prioritize capacity constraints.
2. Use dampening factors to balance global and local factors.
3. Apply penalties for demand overcapacity and depot edges.
4. Incorporate local preferences with dampened distance penalties.
1. Use dampening factors to prevent local optima.
2. Introduce penalties for infeasible edges and depot edges.
3. Incorporate global preferences for promising paths.
4. Normalize to maintain a consistent scale.
1. Use a single base heuristic that balances demand and distance.
2. Apply penalties early to avoid suboptimal paths.
3. Introduce dampening factors to reduce local preferences.
4. Normalize to ensure heuristic values are comparable.
Incorporate cumulative demand, capacity constraints, and local preferences.
Refine dampening factors, add capacity penalty, depot avoidance, and distance-based dampening.
Integrate penalties early, normalize later.
Eliminate redundant dampening factor, normalize earlier.
Use dampening factors for balance, penalize appropriately, and normalize wisely.
- Balance distance and demand, tune weights.
- Early penalties for demand violations.
- Local dampening for depot proximity.
- Normalize for scale, consider max-min.
Incorporate penalties, dampen, and normalize to guide search.
Introduce dampening factors, balance penalties, and normalize for better heuristic balance and scalability.
- Avoid redundant calculations.
- Focus on core heuristics, simplify penalties.
- Ensure penalties reflect real problem costs.
- Optimize normalization for interpretability.
Consider dampening factors to balance demand and distance, and use non-linear dampening based on distance.
1. Balance demand and distance components.
2. Use dampening factors to smooth influence.
3. Apply penalties selectively, not uniformly.
4. Normalize to scale heuristic values.
Incorporate distance preference, dampening, capacity penalties, and local depot preferences.
Optimize with dampening, penalties, and balanced demand-distance weights.
Incorporate local preferences, dynamic dampening, and capacity-based penalties.
Use multiple penalties, dampen excessive influence, and normalize heuristics.
1. Avoid unnecessary components.
2. Apply dampening to stabilize and avoid local optima.
3. Use penalties judiciously to guide towards feasible solutions.
4. Normalize to enhance comparability and encourage exploration.
