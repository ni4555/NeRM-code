Adjust penalties based on problem specifics, balance factors, and dampening factors to encourage diversity and prevent local optima.
Combine diverse penalties, use dampening factors wisely, and promote diversification.
Optimize dampening, personalize penalties, and consider global node preferences.
1. Experiment with dampening factors for penalties.
2. Adjust penalties to focus on more significant violations.
3. Use normalization for heuristic consistency.
