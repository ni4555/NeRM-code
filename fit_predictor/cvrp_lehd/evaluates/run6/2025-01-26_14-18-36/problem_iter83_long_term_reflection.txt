1. Balance exploitation with exploration using adaptive non-linear functions like sigmoid.
2. Normalize demand with capacity, dampen penalties, and consider diversity.
3. Design heuristics to balance between constraints, distance, and flexibility.
4. Modulate penalty severity for diverse scenarios while maintaining balance.
5. Incorporate noise and dampening for exploration, avoiding overfitting and excessive randomness.
