1. Prioritize capacity over distance with dampened penalties, normalize, and balance diversity to avoid local optima.
2. Normalize early, use diversity factors, and adjust penalties dynamically for feasible, balanced solutions.
3. Combine capacity and distance factors, normalize, dampen, and introduce diversity to explore diverse paths.
4. Integrate capacity and distance penalties, normalize for consistency, and fine-tune dampening for stability.
5. Normalize, dampen penalties, and promote diversity to enhance heuristic exploration and feasibility.
