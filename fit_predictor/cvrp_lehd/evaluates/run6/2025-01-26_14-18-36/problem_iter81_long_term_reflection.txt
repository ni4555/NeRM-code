Design heuristics by:
- Balancing exploration and exploitation with a sigmoid function.
- Normalizing demand by capacity and dampening penalties.
- Focusing on demand differences and penalizing constraints.
- Using non-linear transformations for dampening and normalization.
- Modulating penalties and randomness to balance diversity and convergence.
