Description:
Designing an innovative routing strategy for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) necessitates a sophisticated algorithmic approach that optimally manages node traversal under capacity limitations. The core of this strategy involves the strategic application of advanced heuristic and metaheuristic methods, including tabu search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing, to iteratively refine and optimize routes. This process must incorporate capacity-constrained route partitioning techniques, multi-objective optimization frameworks, and adaptive route adjustment mechanisms to accommodate real-time demand variability. Additionally, leveraging big data analytics for predictive demand modeling and integrating machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery will significantly enhance solution accuracy and computational efficiency, ensuring robust and scalable routing solutions.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the potential benefit of each edge
    # The benefit is defined as the product of the distance and the normalized demand
    # which is a common approach in many heuristics for the CVRP
    benefits = distance_matrix * normalized_demands

    # To ensure that the heuristic is meaningful, we can add a small constant
    # to avoid division by zero or very small values
    epsilon = 1e-8
    benefits = benefits + epsilon

    # The heuristic should return negative values for undesirable edges
    # and positive values for promising ones, so we take the negative of the benefits
    heuristics = -benefits

    return heuristics
