Description:
Innovative routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) require a state-of-the-art algorithmic framework that navigates intricate network structures while rigorously respecting vehicle capacity limitations. This framework integrates advanced heuristic algorithms, including ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and deep reinforcement learning, to iteratively refine routing strategies. Central to this approach is the implementation of an intelligent capacity allocation mechanism, coupled with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and real-time route optimization techniques to dynamically adapt to evolving customer demands. By harnessing predictive analytics from extensive data sets to anticipate customer needs and integrating real-time decision-making through advanced reinforcement learning models, the resulting routing systems achieve unparalleled precision and efficiency, ensuring robust and scalable operations with a strong focus on enhancing solution quality and responsiveness.

Code:
import torch
import numpy as np
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure that the input tensors are on the same device (e.g., GPU if available)
    # This is necessary for vectorized operations
    distance_matrix = distance_matrix.to(demands.device)
    demands = demands.to(demands.device)

    # Normalize the demands vector by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Initialize a tensor of the same shape as distance_matrix with zeros
    heuristics = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Compute the heuristics: the negative of the product of the distance and the normalized demand
    # This heuristic assumes that shorter distances and lower demands are more promising
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands

    return heuristics
