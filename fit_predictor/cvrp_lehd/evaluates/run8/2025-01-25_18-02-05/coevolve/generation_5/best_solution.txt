Description:
Advanced routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) require an integrated algorithmic framework that dynamically navigates complex node networks while strictly adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. This framework harnesses a blend of cutting-edge heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and neural network-based approaches, to iteratively optimize routing paths. Central to this approach is the deployment of dynamic capacity allocation strategies, multi-criteria optimization algorithms, and real-time route adaptation mechanisms to handle fluctuating demand. By synergistically incorporating advanced analytics from big data for demand prediction and leveraging deep learning for pattern recognition, the resulting routing systems achieve exceptional accuracy and computational effectiveness, guaranteeing resilient and scalable operations.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity by summing all customer demands
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands to the total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the sum of distances for each edge in the matrix, scaled by demand
    edge_costs = distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    # Subtract the sum of distances from 1 to get heuristics (0-1 scale)
    heuristics = 1 - edge_costs
    
    # Ensure that the heuristics contain negative values for undesirable edges
    heuristics = torch.clamp(heuristics, min=0.0)
    
    return heuristics
