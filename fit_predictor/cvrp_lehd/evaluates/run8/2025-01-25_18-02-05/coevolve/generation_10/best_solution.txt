Description:
Innovative routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) require an advanced algorithmic framework that excels in navigating intricate network topologies. This framework synergizes a fusion of evolutionary algorithms, incorporating genetic algorithms and differential evolution, to iteratively refine routing plans. Central to this approach is the utilization of a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism, which integrates seamlessly with multi-objective optimization techniques to adapt to fluctuating customer requirements. Enhanced by predictive analytics powered by machine learning models and supported by real-time optimization heuristics, the resulting routing systems achieve unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. This method ensures resilient and scalable operations, constantly striving for optimal solution quality and responsiveness through the integration of state-of-the-art evolutionary computation methodologies.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Calculate the "promise" for each edge, which is the negative of the distance
    # multiplied by the demand (since we want negative values for undesirable edges)
    edge_promise = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands

    # We can enhance the heuristic by considering the capacity constraints.
    # For example, we could add a term that encourages visiting customers with higher demands.
    # However, since the problem statement mentions a dynamic capacity allocation, we will
    # simply return the negative distance as the heuristic value.

    return edge_promise
