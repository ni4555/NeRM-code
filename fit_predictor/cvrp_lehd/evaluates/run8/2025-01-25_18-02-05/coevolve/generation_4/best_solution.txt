Description:
Innovative routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) necessitate a sophisticated algorithmic architecture that efficiently traverses node networks while rigorously enforcing vehicle capacity limits. This architecture leverages a fusion of advanced heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, including tabu search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing, to iteratively refine and optimize routing pathways. A cornerstone of this strategy is the implementation of capacity-driven partitioning techniques, multi-objective optimization methodologies, and adaptive route adjustment algorithms to accommodate variable demand. By strategically integrating predictive analytics from big data for demand forecasting and applying machine learning for pattern identification, the resultant routing systems achieve unparalleled precision and computational efficiency, ensuring robust and scalable operations.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of the normalized demands
    demand_sum = demands.sum()
    
    # Compute the potential value for each edge as the negative of the distance
    # multiplied by the demand ratio
    potential = -distance_matrix * (demands / demand_sum)
    
    # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero
    epsilon = 1e-8
    potential = potential + epsilon
    
    # Normalize the potential values to get a heuristic for each edge
    heuristic = potential / potential.sum()
    
    return heuristic
