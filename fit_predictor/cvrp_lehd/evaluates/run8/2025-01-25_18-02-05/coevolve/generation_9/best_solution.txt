Description:
Innovative routing strategies for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) necessitate a cutting-edge algorithmic architecture designed to navigate complex network topologies with precision. This architecture leverages a synergistic blend of advanced heuristic methods such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and deep reinforcement learning, to iteratively optimize routing plans. Core to this methodology is the integration of a sophisticated capacity allocation algorithm, which synergizes with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to dynamically adapt to changing customer demands. Enhanced by predictive analytics derived from vast data sets and supported by real-time optimization techniques, the resultant routing systems deliver exceptional accuracy and efficiency. This approach guarantees robust and scalable operations, with a relentless pursuit of optimal solution quality and responsiveness through the integration of cutting-edge reinforcement learning methodologies.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity (sum of demands)
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Compute the negative of the demands for the heuristics calculation
    negative_demands = -normalized_demands

    # For each edge, compute the heuristic value as the negative demand multiplied by the distance
    # This encourages edges with lower distances and lower demands (i.e., less capacity needed)
    heuristics = negative_demands.view(-1, 1) * distance_matrix

    # Add a small positive constant to avoid log(0) and ensure all values are positive
    epsilon = 1e-8
    heuristics = torch.clamp(heuristics, min=epsilon)

    return heuristics
