Description:
Developing an enhanced algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves optimizing the path planning to efficiently visit all nodes while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. Emphasize the integration of advanced heuristics and metaheuristics, such as tabu search, genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing, to iteratively refine routes. Focus on the implementation of capacity-aware route splitting, multi-objective optimization, and dynamic route adjustments to handle demand fluctuations. Explore the use of big data analytics for demand prediction and machine learning techniques for pattern recognition to improve solution accuracy and efficiency.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of demands to normalize them
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Calculate the potential value for each edge based on normalized demand
    demand_potential = normalized_demands.unsqueeze(1) * normalized_demands.unsqueeze(0)
    
    # Calculate the cost for each edge based on distance
    cost = distance_matrix
    
    # Combine demand potential and cost to get the heuristic value
    heuristic_values = demand_potential - cost
    
    # Set negative values to a very small number to indicate undesirable edges
    undesirable_threshold = -1e-5
    heuristic_values[heuristic_values < undesirable_threshold] = undesirable_threshold
    
    return heuristic_values
