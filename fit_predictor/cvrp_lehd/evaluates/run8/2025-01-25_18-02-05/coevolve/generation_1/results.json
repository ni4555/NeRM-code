  "description": "Developing an enhanced algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves optimizing the path planning to efficiently visit all nodes while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. Emphasize the integration of advanced heuristics and metaheuristics, such as tabu search, genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing, to iteratively refine routes. Focus on the implementation of capacity-aware route splitting, multi-objective optimization, and dynamic route adjustments to handle demand fluctuations. Explore the use of big data analytics for demand prediction and machine learning techniques for pattern recognition to improve solution accuracy and efficiency.",
