Description:
Innovative routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demand a sophisticated algorithmic architecture capable of navigating intricate network structures while rigorously enforcing vehicle capacity limits. This architecture integrates state-of-the-art heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, including ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and deep reinforcement learning techniques, to iteratively refine routing strategies. The core of this methodology involves implementing dynamic capacity management systems, multi-objective optimization algorithms, and adaptive route adjustment mechanisms to address variable customer demands. By synergistically integrating predictive analytics from big data for demand forecasting and employing reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making, the resulting routing systems achieve unparalleled accuracy and efficiency, ensuring robust and scalable operations.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values for each edge
    # Here we use a simple heuristic: the negative of the distance multiplied by the normalized demand
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    return heuristics
