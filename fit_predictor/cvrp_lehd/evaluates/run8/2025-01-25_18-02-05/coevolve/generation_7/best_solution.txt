Description:
Advanced routing strategies for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) necessitate a robust algorithmic framework designed to traverse complex network topologies while meticulously adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. This framework encompasses a blend of cutting-edge heuristic algorithms such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and reinforcement learning, which collectively refine routing solutions iteratively. The cornerstone of this approach is the deployment of an adaptive capacity allocation system, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and dynamic route optimization techniques to adapt to fluctuating customer needs. Leveraging predictive analytics from vast datasets for demand anticipation and incorporating real-time decision-making capabilities via deep reinforcement learning, the resultant routing systems deliver exceptional precision and efficiency, ensuring resilient and scalable operations with an emphasis on enhancing solution quality and adaptability.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure demands are normalized
    demands = demands / demands.sum()
    
    # Compute the heuristics matrix
    # We will use the following heuristic: (1 / distance) * demand
    # We use a large negative constant for the diagonal to avoid self-assignment
    negative_constant = -1e10
    identity_matrix = torch.eye(distance_matrix.shape[0]).to(distance_matrix.device)
    heuristic_matrix = (1 / (distance_matrix + negative_constant)) * demands.unsqueeze(1) * demands.unsqueeze(0)
    
    # Add a large negative constant to the diagonal to ensure no self-assignment
    heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix + identity_matrix * negative_constant
    
    return heuristic_matrix
