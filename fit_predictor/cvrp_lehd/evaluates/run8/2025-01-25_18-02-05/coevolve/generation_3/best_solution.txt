Description:
Innovative routing solutions for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) require a tailored algorithmic framework that adeptly navigates node networks while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints. This framework harnesses a blend of cutting-edge heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, such as tabu search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing, to iteratively refine and optimize routing paths. Central to this approach is the integration of capacity-aware partitioning methods, multi-objective optimization techniques, and dynamic route adjustment algorithms to adapt to fluctuating demand. Furthermore, the strategic use of big data analytics for predictive demand forecasting and the incorporation of machine learning for pattern recognition will significantly elevate solution precision and computational effectiveness, resulting in resilient and scalable routing systems.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of demands to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Compute the heuristics as the negative of the distance multiplied by the normalized demand
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    return heuristics
