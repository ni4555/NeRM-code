1. Prioritize vectorization over loops, balance demand, and break symmetry.
2. Integrate domain knowledge, use cumulative sums, and minimize redundancy.
3. Optimize with capacity checks, normalize inputs, and avoid local optima.
4. Leverage parallel computation, exploit symmetry, and balance exploitation/exploration.
