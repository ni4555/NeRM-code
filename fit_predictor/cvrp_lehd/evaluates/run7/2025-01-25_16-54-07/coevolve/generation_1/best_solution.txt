Description:
Addressing the Enhanced Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (eCVRP) involves formulating an optimal route for vehicles that must satisfy a series of complex constraints. The objective is to devise an efficient algorithm that identifies the shortest route for a fleet of vehicles to visit a predefined set of nodes, covering all demands, while adhering to each vehicle's specific capacity limits. This requires implementing a combination of advanced heuristic strategies, including capacity-based routing, demand-aware vehicle allocation, and dynamic route adjustments to accommodate real-time demand fluctuations. By leveraging techniques such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) modeling, the solution must strike a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, ultimately delivering a robust and scalable approach to tackle the intricate challenges of the eCVRP.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity as the sum of demands
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands by the total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values for each edge
    # A simple heuristic is to use the inverse of the demand, multiplied by the distance
    heuristics = -normalized_demands.unsqueeze(1) * distance_matrix
    
    return heuristics
