  "description": "Addressing the Enhanced Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (eCVRP) involves formulating an optimal route for vehicles that must satisfy a series of complex constraints. The objective is to devise an efficient algorithm that identifies the shortest route for a fleet of vehicles to visit a predefined set of nodes, covering all demands, while adhering to each vehicle's specific capacity limits. This requires implementing a combination of advanced heuristic strategies, including capacity-based routing, demand-aware vehicle allocation, and dynamic route adjustments to accommodate real-time demand fluctuations. By leveraging techniques such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) modeling, the solution must strike a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, ultimately delivering a robust and scalable approach to tackle the intricate challenges of the eCVRP.",
