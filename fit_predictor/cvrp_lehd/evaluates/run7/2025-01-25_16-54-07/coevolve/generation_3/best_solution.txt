Description:
The problem is to develop a heuristic algorithm for solving a Mixed Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP) with time windows and dynamic demand. In this scenario, a fleet of vehicles must deliver goods to a set of customers, each with a specific demand and a time window during which the delivery can occur. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and the delivery schedule must respect the time windows and vehicle capacities.

The MVRP with time windows and dynamic demand (MVRP-TWD) involves the following elements:

1. **Nodes**: Represent customers, with each having a demand, a time window, and a service time.
2. **Vehicles**: Each vehicle has a capacity and a fixed travel time between nodes.
3. **Dynamic Demand**: Some demands may change during the execution of the algorithm, requiring re-optimization of routes.
4. **Time Windows**: Each customer has a specific time window during which the delivery must be made, and the vehicle arrival must not exceed this window.
5. **Capacity Constraints**: The total demand of nodes visited by any vehicle must not exceed its capacity.

The goal is to design a heuristic that:
- Determines an initial feasible solution that respects all time windows and capacity constraints.
- Efficiently incorporates dynamic demand changes into the existing routes.
- Minimizes the total travel time and maximizes the number of satisfied customer requests.
- Uses techniques such as the savings algorithm, savings-based insertion, and genetic algorithms to optimize the routes, considering the trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of demands to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize demands by the total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Initialize the heuristics matrix with zeros
    heuristics = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the savings for each edge
    savings = 2 * (distance_matrix ** 2) - (distance_matrix.sum(dim=1) ** 2) - (distance_matrix.sum(dim=0) ** 2)
    
    # Incorporate normalized demand into savings
    savings = savings - normalized_demands.unsqueeze(1) * distance_matrix
    
    # Apply a penalty for edges that are part of the same route (self-loops)
    savings = savings - (distance_matrix < 1e-6) * 1e6
    
    # Apply a positive heuristics for edges with savings
    heuristics = savings * (savings > 0)
    
    return heuristics
