Description:
The Advanced Dynamic Load Balancing Routing Algorithm (ADLBR) is designed to optimize logistics operations for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and its hybrid variant (hCVRP) by implementing a sophisticated heuristic that emphasizes load distribution and route efficiency. The core algorithm incorporates a dynamic demand evaluation system, ensuring that each vehicle's capacity is maximized without exceeding the defined limit. Key algorithmic aspects include:

- A multi-objective optimization framework that balances distance reduction and load distribution.
- A novel dynamic load balancing strategy that adapts to changing demands and vehicle capacities.
- An intelligent route planning mechanism that leverages cumulative demand masks to enhance load distribution and prevent overcapacity.
- Advanced demand normalization techniques to differentiate between cumulative and normalized demands, thereby optimizing load reflection.
- A cumulative demand analysis module for prioritizing route adjustments in real-time.
- A streamlined demand and capacity management approach to simplify operational complexities.
- A focus on computational efficiency through the integration of optimized algorithms and techniques, ensuring high solution quality without compromising on performance.

    # Calculate the cumulative demand for each node
    cumulative_demand = demands.cumsum(dim=0)
    
    # Calculate the normalized demand for each node
    normalized_demand = cumulative_demand / demands.sum()
    
    # Initialize the heuristics matrix with zeros
    heuristics = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values for each edge
    for i in range(distance_matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(distance_matrix.shape[1]):
            if i != j:
                # Calculate the heuristic value based on distance and demand
                heuristics[i, j] = -distance_matrix[i, j] - normalized_demand[i] + normalized_demand[j]
    
    return heuristics
