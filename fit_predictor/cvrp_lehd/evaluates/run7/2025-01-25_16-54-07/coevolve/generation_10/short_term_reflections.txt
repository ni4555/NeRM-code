1. Clarity on cumulative demand and capacity constraints.
2. Overly simplistic normalization vs. precise edge feasibility mask.
3. Specific algorithmic steps (masking and value assignment) were detailed.
Focus on problem specifics, use precise terminology, and describe algorithmic steps clearly.
Key elements:
- Cumulative demand mask
- Capacity-based prioritization
- Edge feasibility

Misleading aspects:
- Ambiguity in demand and capacity
- Lack of edge feasibility consideration

Optimization insights:
- Cumulative demand vs. total capacity
- Use of mask for feasible edges

Hint: Specify algorithmic details & optimization criteria clearly.
Focus on clear objectives, specific methods, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
