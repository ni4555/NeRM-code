Description:
The problem addresses a refined variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, known as the Adaptive Real-Time Enhanced Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (ARTeCVRP). This variant requires a robust solution approach for optimizing the allocation of a fleet of vehicles across a diverse set of customers with fluctuating demands. The solution must incorporate an advanced combination of heuristic and metaheuristic techniques, including a dynamic greedy algorithm for initial routing, followed by a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with genetic and differential evolution components for iterative improvement. The focus is on real-time adaptation through a real-time feedback loop that continuously evaluates and adjusts vehicle assignments and routes based on evolving customer demands and vehicle capacities, ensuring optimal performance while managing computational complexity.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Create a matrix of negative values for all edges
    heuristics_matrix = -torch.ones_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the potential value for each edge
    # Potential value = distance to customer * demand ratio
    potential_values = distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    # Set the potential values into the heuristics matrix
    heuristics_matrix += potential_values
    
    return heuristics_matrix
