Description:
The hybrid Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (hCVRP) presents a complex challenge in logistics optimization. To address this, we propose a heuristic-based solution that leverages cumulative demand analysis for efficient route planning. This approach involves the development of a cumulative demand mask, which will dynamically assess the total demand of nodes along potential routes, ensuring that each vehicle's load is balanced and optimized.

Our solution will implement a demand normalization strategy to differentiate between cumulative and normalized demands, providing a precise reflection of each vehicle's load distribution. Capacity-based prioritization will be enforced through an edge feasibility mask, which will rigorously evaluate the impact of adding an edge on a vehicle's capacity constraint before incorporating it into a route.

The algorithm will prioritize simplicity and clarity in demand and capacity management, avoiding ambiguity and complexity. Key to our strategy will be the direct utilization of cumulative demand for route prioritization, coupled with optimization techniques that emphasize computational efficiency without compromising solution quality. This balanced approach will enable us to navigate the complexities of hCVRP and deliver robust, effective routing plans for fleet operations.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate cumulative demand
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(demands, dim=0)
    
    # Normalize cumulative demand by total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_cumulative_demand = cumulative_demand / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values
    # Promising edges will have higher normalized cumulative demand
    # Unpromising edges will have lower or negative normalized cumulative demand
    heuristics = normalized_cumulative_demand - distance_matrix
    
    return heuristics
