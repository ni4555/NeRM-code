Description:
The refined approach to addressing the Integrated Capacitated Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problem (iCVRSP) involves the development of a hybrid heuristic strategy that optimally assigns vehicles to customer demands while adhering to strict capacity and time constraints. This strategy prioritizes the use of advanced optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for robust solution exploration and Simulated Annealing (SA) for refining candidate solutions. The core of the solution is a dynamic allocation mechanism that employs a multi-objective evolutionary process, balancing the total distance with the earliest return to the depot to reduce idle times. Real-time adjustments are facilitated through a constraint-driven framework that incorporates linear programming techniques to accommodate fluctuating demand and vehicle availability. This integrated approach ensures a high-quality solution while maintaining computational efficiency through the strategic use of parallel processing and adaptive heuristics.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total distance for each possible route from the depot to any customer and back to the depot
    return_distance = distance_matrix + distance_matrix.transpose(0, 1)
    total_demand = demands + demands

    # Calculate the total distance for each route, weighted by the demand (since the demands are normalized by the total vehicle capacity)
    route_weighted_distance = return_distance * demands

    # Subtract the demand from each edge to encourage visiting customers with higher demands earlier
    # This creates a heuristic that favors routes that include high-demand customers
    heuristic = -route_weighted_distance

    # Ensure that the heuristic has a zero value on the diagonal (edges to the depot from the depot)
    # and that all other values are non-positive to indicate undesirable edges
    heuristic = torch.clamp(heuristic, min=0.0)

    return heuristic
