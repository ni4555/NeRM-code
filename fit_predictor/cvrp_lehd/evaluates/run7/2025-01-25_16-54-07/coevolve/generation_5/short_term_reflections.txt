1. Key elements: demand-driven routing, capacity constraint, cumulative demand.
2. Misleading aspects: "real-time demand fluctuations," CSP modeling without specifics.
3. Algorithmic insights: capacity-based heuristic, dynamic edge evaluation.

Better description hints: Emphasize demand management, capacity constraints, and specific heuristic techniques.
1. Specificity on demand handling, cumulative demand, and capacity-based prioritization.
2. Overgeneralization, lack of specific problem details, and absence of capacity constraint emphasis.
3. Insight into cumulative demand and its impact on capacity constraints.

Hint: Be specific, detail problem constraints, and highlight key optimization strategies.
1. Clear focus on cumulative demand, capacity constraint handling.
2. Avoid abstract terms, prefer concrete optimization strategies.
3. Specify heuristic design choices, e.g., distance modification based on demand.
1. Key elements: Cumulative demand, capacity constraint, and prioritization of feasible edges.
2. Misleading aspects: Overly complex problem formulation, lack of specific heuristics, and no emphasis on capacity constraints.
3. Algorithmic insights: Heuristic prioritization based on feasibility and direct capacity-based adjustments.

Hint: Focus on specific heuristics, capacity constraints, and feasibility criteria.
Key elements: Specific algorithm, cumulative demand, edge prioritization.

Misled by: Vague heuristics, capacity balance, CSP, real-time adjustments.

Better captured: Exact algorithmic steps, demand constraint handling, mask for edge quality.
