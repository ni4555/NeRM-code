def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Use cumulative demand as the evaluation criterion directly
    edge_evaluation = edge_capacity_impact
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Apply a more dynamic threshold based on the vehicle capacity
    threshold = torch.max(edge_evaluation) / 2

    # Further refine the promise by reducing the impact of higher demands and considering edge costs
    edge_promise *= (1 - edge_capacity_impact / (1 + edge_capacity_impact))
    edge_promise *= torch.exp(-distance_matrix / torch.max(distance_matrix))
