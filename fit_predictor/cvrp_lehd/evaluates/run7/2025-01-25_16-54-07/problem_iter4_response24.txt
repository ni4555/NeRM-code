    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Define a clear and objective evaluation method for edges
    # Using cumulative demand as the evaluation criterion

    # Using a dynamic threshold based on the average edge capacity impact
