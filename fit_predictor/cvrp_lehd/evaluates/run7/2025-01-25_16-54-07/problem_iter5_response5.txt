def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Use a combination of distance and demand impact with a penalty for high cumulative demand
    edge_evaluation = distance_matrix + (edge_capacity_impact / (1 + edge_capacity_impact))

    # Reflection adjustments:
    # Integrate cumulative demand directly; simplify evaluations with single metrics.
    # Dynamically adapt thresholds based on edge quality & problem specifics.
    # Balance demand with capacity; apply penalties and rewards intuitively.
    # Minimize loops & complexity; leverage vectorized operations & stable math.
    
    # Adjust the threshold calculation to be more dynamic and responsive to the problem specifics
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < (dynamic_threshold - edge_evaluation.std() * 0.5), -1.0, 1.0)
