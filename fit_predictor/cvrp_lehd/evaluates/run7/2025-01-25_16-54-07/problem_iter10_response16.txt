```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Use cumulative demand as the evaluation criterion directly
    edge_evaluation = cumulative_demand
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Apply a dynamic threshold based on the maximum cumulative demand
    max_cumulative_demand = cumulative_demand.max()
    threshold = max_cumulative_demand * 0.5
    
    # Further refine the promise by reducing the impact of higher demands
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    edge_promise *= (1 - edge_capacity_impact / (1 + edge_capacity_impact))
    
    return edge_promise
