    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand

    # Introduce penalties for long or high-demand edges

    high_demand_penalty = torch.where(normalized_demands > 0.1, -1.0, 0.0)  # Adjust the threshold for high demand
    edge_evaluation += long_distance_penalty + high_demand_penalty
    
    # Enhance promising edges with a gradient ascent approach
    gradient_ascent = torch.where(edge_evaluation > 0, edge_evaluation, 0.0)

    # Normalize the evaluation to ensure a balanced approach
    edge_promise = edge_evaluation / edge_evaluation.max()
