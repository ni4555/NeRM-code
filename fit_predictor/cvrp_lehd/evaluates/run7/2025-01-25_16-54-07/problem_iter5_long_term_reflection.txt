1. Integrate cumulative demand directly; simplify evaluations with single metrics.
2. Dynamically adapt thresholds based on edge quality & problem specifics.
3. Balance demand with capacity; apply penalties and rewards intuitively.
4. Minimize loops & complexity; leverage vectorized operations & stable math.
