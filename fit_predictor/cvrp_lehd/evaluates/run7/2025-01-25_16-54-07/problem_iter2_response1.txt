```python
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Define a clear and objective evaluation method for edges
    # We combine the distance with the cumulative demand impact and add a demand penalty
    edge_evaluation = edge_capacity_impact + torch.sqrt(torch.abs(distance_matrix)) - 0.1 * cumulative_demand
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Use a dynamic threshold based on the maximum edge evaluation to prioritize
    max_edge_eval = edge_evaluation.max()
    dynamic_threshold = max_edge_eval * 0.7  # This threshold is adjusted dynamically
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < dynamic_threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    return edge_promise
