```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Evaluate edges based on distance and cumulative demand impact
    edge_evaluation = distance_matrix + edge_capacity_impact
    
    # Normalize edge evaluation to a range between 0 and 1
    max_demand = cumulative_demand.max()
    edge_evaluation = edge_evaluation / (1 + max_demand)
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Use a dynamic threshold for edge selection
    dynamic_threshold = edge_evaluation.mean()
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < dynamic_threshold, 1.0, -1.0)
    
    return edge_promise
