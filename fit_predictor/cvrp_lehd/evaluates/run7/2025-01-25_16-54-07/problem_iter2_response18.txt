```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    # Demand normalization
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Define a clear and objective evaluation method for edges
    # We use the cumulative demand as the evaluation criterion
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # We use a simple threshold to determine if an edge is promising or not
    # Negative values for undesirable edges, positive for promising ones
    threshold = 0.5  # This threshold can be adjusted based on the problem specifics
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_capacity_impact < threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    return edge_promise
