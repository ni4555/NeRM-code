    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask

    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Use a combination of distance and demand impact with a penalty for high cumulative demand
    edge_evaluation = distance_matrix + (edge_capacity_impact / (1 + edge_capacity_impact))

    # Dynamic threshold based on edge evaluation to prioritize
    dynamic_threshold = edge_evaluation.mean()
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < dynamic_threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # 2. Balance demand with capacity; apply penalties and rewards intuitively
    # Introduce a demand-to-capacity ratio penalty
    capacity = 1.0  # Example capacity value
    demand_to_capacity_ratio = cumulative_demand / capacity
    edge_promise = torch.where(demand_to_capacity_ratio > 1, edge_promise * 0.8, edge_promise)
    
    # 1. Integrate cumulative demand directly; simplify evaluations with single metrics
    # Update the edge promise based on the cumulative demand
    edge_promise = edge_promise * (1 - cumulative_demand)
