```python
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    # Demand normalization
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Use a modified Euclidean distance to account for demand
    edge_evaluation = torch.sqrt((distance_matrix ** 2) + (cumulative_demand ** 2))
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Use a more nuanced approach to edge selection
    # Promising edges are those that minimize the modified distance while respecting capacity
    threshold = (distance_matrix.min() + 1) / 2  # This threshold can be adjusted based on the problem specifics
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < threshold, edge_evaluation, -edge_evaluation)
    
    return edge_promise
