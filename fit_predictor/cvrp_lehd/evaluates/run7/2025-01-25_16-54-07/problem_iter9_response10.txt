import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Cumulative demand mask
    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # Modify edge evaluation to consider the inverse of distance for more direct paths
    edge_evaluation = 1.0 / (1.0 + edge_capacity_impact)
    
    # 4. Optimization Strategies
    # Apply a dynamic threshold based on cumulative demand and vehicle capacity
    max_demand = total_demand
    threshold = max_demand * 0.2  # This threshold can be adjusted based on the problem specifics
    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Further refine the promise by prioritizing paths with lower cumulative demand
    edge_promise *= (1 - cumulative_demand)
