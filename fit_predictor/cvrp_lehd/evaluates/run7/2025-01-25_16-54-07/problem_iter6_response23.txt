def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # 1. Precise Demand Handling
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand

    cumulative_demand = torch.cumsum(normalized_demands, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Capacity Constraint Prioritization
    # Edge feasibility mask
    edge_capacity_impact = distance_matrix * cumulative_demand
    
    # 3. Clear Edge Evaluation
    # We combine the distance with the cumulative demand impact and add a demand penalty

    # Use a dynamic threshold based on the maximum edge evaluation to prioritize

    edge_promise = torch.where(edge_evaluation < dynamic_threshold, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Further refinement by penalizing heavily loaded edges and rewarding lighter ones
    heavy_load_penalty = torch.where(edge_capacity_impact > 0.8, -2.0, 0.0)
    light_load_reward = torch.where(edge_capacity_impact < 0.2, 2.0, 0.0)
    edge_promise = edge_promise + heavy_load_penalty + light_load_reward
