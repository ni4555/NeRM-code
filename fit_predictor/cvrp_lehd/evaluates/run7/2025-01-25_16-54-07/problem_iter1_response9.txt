    # We introduce a gradient ascent on the evaluation score to prioritize edges
    # We simulate a simple gradient ascent step by adjusting a temperature parameter

            break
        temperature *= 0.9  # Cooling rate

    # Negative values for undesirable edges, positive for promising ones
