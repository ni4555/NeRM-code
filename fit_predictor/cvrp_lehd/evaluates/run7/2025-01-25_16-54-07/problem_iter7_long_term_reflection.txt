1. Integrate cumulative demand directly, simplify complexity, and adapt thresholds dynamically.
2. Prioritize capacity constraints, use vectorized operations, and minimize loops.
3. Balance demand and capacity with intuitive penalties, and refine edge evaluations.
4. Optimize complexity, leverage max cumulative demand as a threshold, and enhance evaluations.
