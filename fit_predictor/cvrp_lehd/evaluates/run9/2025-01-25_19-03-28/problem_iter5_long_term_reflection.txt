1. Integrate weighted demand & distance with non-linear penalties, normalize, and dynamically adjust weights.
2. Balance diversity and demand variance, normalize, and apply threshold constraints.
3. Incorporate cumulative demand, capacity, and global network stats, balancing with edge penalties.
4. Normalize, smooth, and penalize outliers; enforce limits for heuristic stability.
