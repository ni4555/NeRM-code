description: 'The new problem description is as follows:


  Design a hybrid optimization heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
  (CVRP) that incorporates real-time demand forecasts. The heuristic should integrate
  a genetic algorithm for global search with a constraint-based local search to refine
  solutions. It should employ a multi-objective evolutionary approach to optimize
  for travel distance, vehicle load balance, and service time. The goal is to achieve
  an efficient and cost-effective routing strategy that maximizes resource utilization
  while maintaining adaptability to dynamic demand changes.'
