Description:
Integrate a predictive routing subsystem with high-accuracy real-time demand projections into an advanced algorithmic framework for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Utilize a hybrid approach that synergizes genetic algorithms for broad-scale exploration and constraint-based local search for precise solution optimization. Emphasize the use of multi-objective evolutionary strategies to harmonize objectives such as reduced travel distance, even vehicle load distribution, and minimized service time. This comprehensive methodology aims to achieve a balanced allocation of resources, optimizing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness while ensuring resilient and adaptive service delivery.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands vector to the range [0, 1]
    demands_normalized = demands / demands.sum()

    # Calculate the maximum demand as a baseline for comparison
    max_demand = demands.max()

    # Compute the heuristics as the product of normalized demands and distance matrix
    heuristics = demands_normalized * distance_matrix

    # Subtract the maximum demand from the heuristics to make the values negative for undesirable edges
    heuristics -= max_demand

    # Add a small constant to avoid zero values which can cause numerical instability
    heuristics += 1e-10

    return heuristics
