Description:
Integrate a predictive routing subsystem with ultra-precise real-time demand forecasts into a cutting-edge algorithmic architecture for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Implement a sophisticated hybrid strategy that leverages the global search capabilities of genetic algorithms in conjunction with the refined optimization of constraint-based local search. Prioritize multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to optimize multiple conflicting objectives, including minimizing travel distance, ensuring balanced vehicle loads, and reducing service time. This integrated approach seeks to achieve an optimal balance between resource allocation, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, while ensuring robust and adaptable service delivery.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Ensure the distance matrix and demands are both tensors and the demands are normalized
    distance_matrix = distance_matrix.clone().detach().to(torch.float32)
    demands = demands.clone().detach().to(torch.float32)
    
    # Calculate the demand contribution to the heuristics (using normalized demands)
    demand_contrib = 1.0 / (demands + 1e-6)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero
    
    # Calculate the heuristics based on distance and demand contributions
    # For each edge, calculate the heuristics value as the difference between the distance
    # and a weighted demand contribution
    heuristics = distance_matrix - demand_contrib.unsqueeze(1) * demand_contrib.unsqueeze(0)
    
    return heuristics
