      "description": "Assisting in solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with some prior heuristics. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.",

Implement a sophisticated hybrid strategy that leverages the global search capabilities of genetic algorithms in conjunction with the refined optimization of constraint-based local search. Prioritize multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to optimize multiple conflicting objectives, including minimizing travel distance, ensuring balanced vehicle loads, and reducing service time. This integrated approach seeks to achieve an optimal balance between resource allocation, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, while ensuring robust and adaptable service delivery.",
