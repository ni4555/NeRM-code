  "description": "Develop a cutting-edge algorithmic architecture for addressing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by fusing a proactive dynamic routing module with precise real-time demand forecasts and top-tier optimization methodologies. Employ a fusion strategy that leverages both genetic algorithms for extensive global search and constraint-based local search for refined solution fine-tuning. Prioritize the application of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to optimize a comprehensive set of objectives, encompassing minimized travel distance, optimized vehicle capacity distribution, and minimized service latency. This approach aims to achieve a balanced resource allocation that maximizes operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness while ensuring robust and responsive service delivery.",
