Description:
Optimize the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through an integrated algorithmic framework that incorporates dynamic path selection, real-time demand forecasting, and advanced heuristic methods. Prioritize the integration of capacitated sub-problems using a hybrid approach, blending local search, genetic algorithms, and constraint-based optimization techniques to achieve a robust and efficient solution. Focus on the development of a multi-objective strategy that balances the total distance, vehicle utilization, and service time, aiming for an optimal allocation of resources and minimization of operational costs.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Compute the potential utility of each edge as a function of distance and demand
    # We use a simple heuristic: a smaller distance and higher demand lead to a higher utility
    # The heuristic formula: utility = demand - (distance * some_penalty_factor)
    # We use a negative penalty factor for distance to encourage shorter paths
    penalty_factor = 0.1
    edge_potential = normalized_demands - (distance_matrix * penalty_factor)
    
    # Apply a threshold to ensure that the utility is non-negative for promising edges
    # and negative or zero for undesirable edges
    threshold = 0.01
    edge_potential = torch.clamp(edge_potential, min=threshold, max=0)
    
    return edge_potential
