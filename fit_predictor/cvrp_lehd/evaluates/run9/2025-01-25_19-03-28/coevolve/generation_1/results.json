  "description": "Optimize the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through an integrated algorithmic framework that incorporates dynamic path selection, real-time demand forecasting, and advanced heuristic methods. Prioritize the integration of capacitated sub-problems using a hybrid approach, blending local search, genetic algorithms, and constraint-based optimization techniques to achieve a robust and efficient solution. Focus on the development of a multi-objective strategy that balances the total distance, vehicle utilization, and service time, aiming for an optimal allocation of resources and minimization of operational costs.",
