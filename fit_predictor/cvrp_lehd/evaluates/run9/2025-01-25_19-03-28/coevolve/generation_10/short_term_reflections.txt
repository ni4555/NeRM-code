1. Specific objectives, demand normalization, and distance-weighted heuristics.
2. Overly complex strategy, lack of clarity on optimization objectives, and lack of implementation details.
3. Clarity on CVRP specifics, heuristic design based on problem constraints, and simplified objectives.
1. Key elements: Specific problem context, demands normalization, heuristic based on demand and distance.
2. Misleading aspects: Overly complex strategy without clear implementation details, lack of specific heuristic methods.
3. Better insights: Emphasis on algorithmic components (heuristics, normalization), practicality in problem definition.

Better hints:
Be concise, specify objectives, describe algorithm components clearly.
1. Focus on specific heuristics.
2. Avoid overly complex descriptions.
3. Define clear objectives and constraints.
4. Use practical examples over theoretical frameworks.
