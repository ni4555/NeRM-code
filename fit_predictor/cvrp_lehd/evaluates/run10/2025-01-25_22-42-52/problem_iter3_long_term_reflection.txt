Design heuristics by:
- Prioritizing cumulative demand, capacity, and shortest feasible distances.
- Minimizing calculations, leveraging vectorization, and penalizing overcapacity.
- Using capacity-aware heuristics and focusing on nearest feasible customers.
- Combining domain knowledge with algorithmic efficiency.
