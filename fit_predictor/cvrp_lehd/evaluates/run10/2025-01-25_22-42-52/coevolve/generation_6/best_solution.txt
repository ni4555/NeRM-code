Description:
This cutting-edge solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) integrates a sophisticated blend of advanced metaheuristics and optimized routing techniques. At its core, this method leverages the power of evolutionary algorithms and simulation-based optimization to delve deeply into complex solution spaces while finely tuning neighborhood structures. The approach stands out by employing state-of-the-art adaptive genetic algorithms, enhanced with custom mutation and crossover operators, providing robust traversal through varied solution landscapes. Enhanced with a refined simulated annealing process for flexibility, this method further excels in dynamic optimization. Advanced capacity management and comprehensive multi-objective optimization strategies are integrated to iteratively optimize both cost-effectiveness and service excellence.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity

    # Compute the heuristic values for each edge
    # Here we use a simple heuristic that is a function of the normalized demand and distance
    # This is a placeholder for a more sophisticated heuristic that would be defined here
    heuristic_values = -normalized_demands * distance_matrix

    return heuristic_values
