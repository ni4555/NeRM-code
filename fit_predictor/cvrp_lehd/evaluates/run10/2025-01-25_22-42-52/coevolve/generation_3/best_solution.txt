Description:
Integrating advanced heuristic algorithms for optimizing CVRP resolution, the proposed solution emphasizes the development of cutting-edge routing strategies. By focusing on dynamic and adaptive techniques, it ensures comprehensive coverage while respecting capacity constraints. The approach harnesses the power of evolutionary algorithms and real-time simulation-based optimization to delve into intricate solution spaces and effectively navigate neighborhood structures. A key highlight is the implementation of adaptive genetic algorithms with real-time mutation and crossover operations, coupled with dynamic simulated annealing for robust exploration of diverse solution landscapes. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent capacity adjustment and multi-objective optimization ensures a strategic balance between minimizing costs and maximizing service quality.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the maximum distance in the matrix to use as a scaling factor
    max_distance = torch.max(distance_matrix)
    
    # Normalize the distance matrix with the maximum distance to scale the values
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / max_distance
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    vehicle_capacity = demands.sum()
    normalized_demands = demands / vehicle_capacity
    
    # Compute the heuristics as the product of the normalized distance and the normalized demand
    heuristics = normalized_distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    # To ensure the matrix contains negative values for undesirable edges and positive ones for promising ones,
    # we add a constant that is the sum of the maximum distance and the maximum demand.
    # This constant ensures that at least one edge is considered promising (has a positive heuristic value).
    constant = max_distance + torch.max(normalized_demands)
    heuristics = heuristics + constant
