  "description": "Integrating advanced heuristic algorithms for optimizing CVRP resolution, the proposed solution emphasizes the development of cutting-edge routing strategies. By focusing on dynamic and adaptive techniques, it ensures comprehensive coverage while respecting capacity constraints. The approach harnesses the power of evolutionary algorithms and real-time simulation-based optimization to delve into intricate solution spaces and effectively navigate neighborhood structures. A key highlight is the implementation of adaptive genetic algorithms with real-time mutation and crossover operations, coupled with dynamic simulated annealing for robust exploration of diverse solution landscapes. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent capacity adjustment and multi-objective optimization ensures a strategic balance between minimizing costs and maximizing service quality.",
