Description:
Innovative approaches to CVRP resolution are achieved through the fusion of state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and sophisticated routing methodologies. This solution leverages advanced dynamic and adaptive algorithms to ensure optimal coverage and adhere to stringent capacity limits. The core of the strategy involves incorporating cutting-edge evolutionary algorithms, coupled with simulation-based optimization for deep exploration of complex solution spaces and precise navigation of neighborhood structures. A pivotal feature is the integration of adaptive genetic algorithms with dynamic mutation and crossover mechanisms, enhanced by an adaptive simulated annealing process for robust exploration of diverse solution landscapes. Additionally, intelligent capacity management and multi-objective optimization techniques are employed to strike a strategic equilibrium between cost minimization and service quality enhancement.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Normalize demands to the range [0, 1]
    demands_normalized = demands / demands.sum()
    
    # Calculate the difference in demand between each customer and the average demand
    demand_diff = demands_normalized - demands_normalized.mean()
    
    # Use the difference in demand as a heuristic
    heuristics = demand_diff * distance_matrix
    
    # Ensure the heuristic values are negative for undesirable edges and positive for promising ones
    heuristics[distance_matrix == 0] = 0  # Set the diagonal to zero, as the depot should not be included in the solution
    heuristics[heuristics < 0] = 0  # Set negative values to zero
    
    return heuristics
