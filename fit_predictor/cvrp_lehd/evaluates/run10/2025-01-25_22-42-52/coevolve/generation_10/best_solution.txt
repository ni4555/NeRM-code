Description:
This advanced VRP solution employs a synergistic fusion of cutting-edge evolutionary algorithms and real-time dynamic routing techniques. At the heart lies a robust genetic algorithm, enhanced with sophisticated mutation and crossover operators, adeptly navigating complex solution spaces with exceptional granularity. Amplifying this foundation, an integrated parallel simulated annealing module facilitates real-time adaptation to dynamic real-world conditions. The solution is further reinforced with state-of-the-art capacity allocation strategies and a comprehensive multi-objective optimization engine, meticulously balancing cost-effectiveness and service excellence to deliver optimal performance across diverse operational scenarios.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of demands to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Calculate the normalized demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Calculate the heuristics using the formula:
    # heuristics = -distance * demand
    # This will give negative values for undesirable edges and positive values for promising ones
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    return heuristics
