Description:
Optimizing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms. This approach prioritizes the development of innovative strategies for routing vehicles, ensuring full coverage of nodes while adhering to stringent capacity limits and minimizing overall travel distance. The solution leverages cutting-edge metaheuristics, including Adaptive Genetic Algorithms and Dynamic Simulated Annealing, to comprehensively explore diverse solution landscapes and efficiently utilize neighborhood structures. The emphasis is on implementing sophisticated capacity adjustments, real-time route modifications, and multi-objective optimization techniques to achieve a harmonious balance between cost minimization and service level fulfillment.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands by the total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristics using a simple approach:
    # The heuristic for an edge is the negative of the distance multiplied by the normalized demand
    heuristics = -distance_matrix * normalized_demands
    
    return heuristics
