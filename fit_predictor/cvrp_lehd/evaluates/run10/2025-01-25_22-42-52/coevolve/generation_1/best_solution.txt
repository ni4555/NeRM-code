Description:
Enhancing the resolution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through the implementation of advanced heuristic algorithms. This involves optimizing the routing of vehicles to cover all nodes, adhering to strict capacity constraints, and minimizing total travel distance. The approach emphasizes the integration of metaheuristics, such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, to explore diverse solution spaces and exploit neighborhood structures effectively. The algorithmic focus is on adaptive capacity management, dynamic route adjustments, and multi-objective optimization, aiming to achieve a balance between minimizing cost and ensuring service level agreements.

Code:
import torch
import torch

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    # Calculate the total demand
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    # Normalize demands by total vehicle capacity
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    # Calculate the heuristics based on the normalized demands
    heuristics = distance_matrix * normalized_demands.unsqueeze(1) * normalized_demands.unsqueeze(0)
    return heuristics
