Description:
This advanced VRP solution leverages a fusion of cutting-edge metaheuristics and dynamic routing techniques. Central to its design is an adaptive genetic algorithm, which employs sophisticated mutation and crossover operators to navigate complex solution spaces efficiently. Enhanced adaptability is achieved through a synergistic integration of simulated annealing, allowing the algorithm to tackle intricate real-world challenges with remarkable flexibility. The solution is bolstered by advanced capacity management strategies and a robust multi-objective optimization engine, meticulously balancing cost and service quality to deliver optimal outcomes.

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the sum of all demands to normalize
    total_demand = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands vector
    normalized_demands = demands / total_demand
    
    # Compute the heuristic values based on the normalized demands
    # Negative values for undesirable edges (high demand)
    # Positive values for promising edges (low demand)
    heuristics = -normalized_demands * distance_matrix
    
    return heuristics
