Description:
This innovative VRP solution harnesses a cutting-edge combination of hybrid metaheuristics and dynamic routing methodologies. At its core, it employs a state-of-the-art adaptive genetic algorithm framework, incorporating tailored mutation and crossover strategies for enhanced traversal across diverse solution landscapes. The algorithm's adaptability is further augmented by an integrated simulated annealing technique, optimizing flexibility and resilience in the face of complex, real-world scenarios. The approach incorporates sophisticated capacity management mechanisms and employs a multi-objective optimization framework, iteratively balancing cost and service quality for unparalleled optimization results.

Code:

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Calculate the total vehicle capacity
    total_capacity = demands.sum()
    
    # Normalize the demands
    normalized_demands = demands / total_capacity
    
    # Calculate the heuristic values based on the normalized demands
    # For simplicity, we'll use a simple heuristic where the heuristic value is inversely proportional to the demand
    # and also take into account the distance to encourage closer customers
    heuristics = -normalized_demands * distance_matrix
    
    return heuristics
