1. Prioritize edges with high demand differences, leveraging vectorized calculations.
2. Minimize cumulative demand and capacity evaluations using efficient shift operations.
3. Use vectorized distance penalties and conditional overcapacity to guide search.
4. Optimize for nearest feasible customer and avoid unnecessary loops.
