description: The problem involves using a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal
  placement of decaps within a power grid infrastructure. The goal is to achieve a
  balanced and efficient distribution of power, minimizing energy loss and maximizing
  system reliability. The algorithm operates in a black-box fashion, where the fitness
  of potential solutions is evaluated based on empirical performance metrics derived
  from the power grid simulation. To enhance optimization performance, the genetic
  algorithm incorporates adaptive mutation rates and parallelized selection processes,
  ensuring rapid convergence and high precision in identifying the most effective
  decap placement configurations.
