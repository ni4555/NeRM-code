description: The design of a novel algorithm aims to optimize the Multi-dimensional
  Knapsack Problem (MKP) by integrating advanced hybrid stochastic approaches. This
  approach utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to adaptively explore the solution space,
  enhancing solution diversity and exploration, while incorporating a Monte Carlo
  Optimization (MCO) technique for rapid feasibility evaluation. The GA's adaptive
  mutation rate and selection strategy are fine-tuned to balance convergence speed
  and solution quality. Additionally, a Multi-start optimization technique is employed
  to generate multiple feasible solutions, further enhancing the robustness of the
  algorithm. The combined use of these specific techniques ensures an efficient and
  effective MKP solution that optimizes the trade-off between computational resources
  and solution quality.
