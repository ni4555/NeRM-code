description: Develop an innovative algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
  (CVRP) that combines cutting-edge heuristics and metaheuristics to systematically
  refine route configurations. The proposed solution should initiate with a nearest
  neighbor heuristic for initial route generation, followed by an integration of savings-based
  and savings-improvement techniques to minimize route distances. Enhance the initial
  solution through a hybrid genetic algorithm, incorporating tabu search to explore
  diverse solutions while avoiding陷入局部最优。 The genetic algorithm should be designed
  with a fitness function centered on minimizing route length and optimizing vehicle
  capacity, aiming for a fitness score threshold below 160. To maintain a balanced
  service, dynamically redistribute demands across vehicles. Throughout the process,
  meticulously document the iterative improvements made by each heuristic and metaheuristic
  to illustrate their contribution to overcoming local optima. Finally, evaluate the
  algorithm's efficiency by demonstrating significant improvements in capacity utilization,
  route length reduction, and demand balance compared to established CVRP methods.
